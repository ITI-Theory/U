# Introduction: When Feeling Has a Type

Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) introduced a striking philosophical claim alongside its technical machinery: that mathematical *equality* is not a flat, binary relation but a space — that two things can be equal in multiple ways, and that the topology of those equalities is mathematically significant. The univalence axiom, in Voevodsky's formulation, says that equivalent structures are *identical* — not merely isomorphic, but literally the same object from the perspective of the type theory. This is not just a technical convenience; it is a philosophical claim about the nature of mathematical objects.

The Universal Somatic Field framework makes an analogous claim about felt experience: that experience is not a flat, undifferentiated phenomenon but a *typed* object — that there is a type of awe, a type of grief, a type of contentment, and that the relationships between these types have a topology that can be expressed in dependent type theory and verified by a proof assistant. This book develops that claim and its mathematical consequences.

## The ScaleUniverse Type

The most distinctive mathematical object in the USF framework is the `ScaleUniverse` type — a dependent type parameterised by a discrete scale index ranging from 0 (quantum, sub-cellular) to 19 (cosmological, civilisational). At each scale, the somatic field has a different instantiation: the field at scale 3 is the single-neuron electromagnetic field; at scale 7, it is the whole-brain somatic field; at scale 12, it is the inter-personal relational field; at scale 17, it is the civilisational attractor structure.

The `ScaleUniverse` type is not a metaphor for scale-invariance. It is a precise Lean 4 inductive type, and the claim that the same field equation governs all 20 scales is expressed as a Lean 4 theorem: a function from any scale index to a proof that the canonical somatic field equation holds at that scale, with appropriate dimension-adjusted coupling constants. The proof is machine-checked. The scale-invariance is not an empirical observation about pattern similarity; it is a mathematical identity.

This places the USF framework in a tradition that algebraic topology and HoTT have made precise: that the deep structure of a phenomenon is captured by the *map* between its manifestations at different scales, not by any single manifestation. The `ScaleUniverse` type is the USF's answer to the ∞-groupoid: the object that tracks not just what exists at each scale but how the scales are related.

## The Consciousness Threshold Theorem

One of the formal results in this volume is what we call the **consciousness threshold theorem**: a sharp dichotomy, proved in Lean 4, stating that for any somatic field configuration $\Phi$, either the field amplitude exceeds a critical threshold $T_c$ (in which case the system supports a stable phenomenal attractor, and there is something it is like to be that system) or it does not (in which case there is not). The dichotomy is sharp: there is no continuum of partial consciousness, no gradation between experience and non-experience. The threshold is the phase transition.

The proof proceeds by showing that the attractor stability condition is equivalent to a strict inequality on the spectral gap of the somatic field operator. Below the threshold, the spectral gap closes, and the field dynamics become diffusive rather than attractive — there are no stable experiential states. Above the threshold, the gap is open, attractors are stable, and the phenomenological interpretation is that the field is doing something that merits the name *experience*.

For the type theorist, the consciousness threshold theorem is an application of a dichotomy type — a `Sum` type in Lean 4 — to a physically measurable quantity. The proof that consciousness is a phase transition is simultaneously a proof that the relevant type is inhabited.

## Dependent Types as Proof Architecture

The USF framework's use of dependent types goes beyond verification of specific theorems. The architecture of the Lean 4 proofs is designed so that the type signatures carry the physical content: a proof that the somatic propagator reduces to the EM propagator is a term of a specific dependent type, and the type signature *is* the mathematical claim. This means that the type system enforces the physical constraints automatically: it is impossible to state a physically incoherent claim as a Lean 4 theorem, because the type checker will reject it before the proof attempt begins.

This is the formal mathematics ideal applied to physics: not just rigour after the fact, but rigour built into the structure of the formalism. The papers in this volume develop the type architecture in detail, showing how the physical constraints of the somatic field — energy positivity, covariance, the compactification boundary conditions — become type constraints in the Lean 4 development.

## The Algebraic Topology of Emotion

One further strand of mathematical development in this volume concerns the topological invariants of the somatic field's attractor landscape. The attractor basins form a simplicial complex: basins that share a saddle point are joined by an edge; clusters of basins form higher-dimensional faces. The homology groups of this complex are topological invariants of the emotional landscape — they do not change under continuous deformations of the landscape, only under topological changes such as basin mergers (two emotions becoming indistinguishable) or bifurcations (one emotion splitting into two).

The persistent homology of the somatic attractor complex is therefore a mathematical invariant of a person's emotional landscape — one that changes only through significant life events, therapeutic interventions, or pathological processes. This connects the USF framework to the active field of topological data analysis, where persistent homology is already used to analyse high-dimensional datasets.

## What This Book Offers the Mathematician

The papers assembled here are written for the reader comfortable with dependent type theory, algebraic topology, and formal verification. No physics or neuroscience background is assumed beyond what is introduced. The intended reader might be a type theorist curious about physical applications of HoTT, or an algebraic topologist interested in persistent homology applied to field theories, or a logician interested in the formal structure of phenomenological claims.

Chapter 2 presents the mathematical co-identification paper: the core identification of the somatic field with a family of well-known mathematical objects, with Lean 4 proofs. Chapter 3 develops the field equation and its properties from the perspective of nonlinear functional analysis. Chapters 4 and 5 (the universal and zoomable somatic field papers) develop the scale-invariance structure and the `ScaleUniverse` type in full. The final chapter draws out the mathematical research questions the framework opens: the spectral theory of the somatic operator, the persistent homology of the attractor complex, and the homotopy-theoretic interpretation of emotional transitions.

The type checks. The proof is constructive. Read on.

# Introduction: The Two-Culture Problem Within Science

C. P. Snow's famous lecture identified a divide between the literary and scientific
cultures [@snow1959]. Less discussed, but equally consequential, is the divide *within*
mathematical science: between fields that have found their mathematical language and
fields that have not. The former possess machines — theorems, dualities, conservation
laws, spectral decompositions — that can be aimed at any problem of the appropriate
type. The latter rediscover wheels.

This is not ignorance. It is, more precisely, a naming problem. The mathematical
structures that govern quantum field theory, statistical mechanics, and information
geometry are not *specifically about* particles, spins, or probability distributions.
They are structures that happen to have been *discovered in* those contexts. The
structure belongs to no discipline. It lives in what we will call, following the
spirit of type theory, the **typeverse**: the space of all well-typed mathematical
objects.

The method described in this paper — **mathematical co-identification** — is the
procedure for navigating the typeverse productively. It has three steps:

1. **Extract the type signature** of the quantity you are trying to model:
   its dimensional units, its pole structure, its symmetries, the variational
   principle (if any) that governs its dynamics.

2. **Search the typeverse** for a known object with the same type signature.

3. **If found: identify**, not analogise. The unknown quantity *is* the known
   object under a change of label. Import all theorems that depend only on the
   type.

This is a stronger claim than analogy. Analogy notes structural similarity and stops.
Co-identification notes structural identity and continues: if two objects have the
same type, they share all properties that are consequences of that type. The theorems
travel with the identification.

It is also a weaker claim than reduction. Co-identification does not assert that
emotional dynamics *reduces to* quantum field theory, any more than Hopfield's result
asserts that neural memory *reduces to* ferromagnetism. It asserts that the same
mathematical engine, running in a different substrate, produces the same theorems.
The substrate is irrelevant to the mathematics; it is entirely relevant to the
interpretation.

---

# The Typeverse

The term is borrowed from Homotopy Type Theory [@hottbook], where the *universe*
$\mathcal{U}$ is the type of all types — the space in which all mathematical objects
live. We use it informally to mean: the totality of well-typed mathematical structures,
indexed by their signatures.

A **type signature** in our sense includes:

- **Dimensional units** (in the SI or natural-units sense)
- **Domain and codomain** (real/complex, scalar/vector/tensor)
- **Pole structure** (where is the object singular, and what is the residue?)
- **Symmetries** (what transformations leave the object invariant?)
- **Extremisation principle** (is there an action whose variation gives the object's
  dynamics?)
- **Conservation law** (what is the Noether charge associated with the symmetry?)

Two objects are **co-identifiable** if their type signatures match in all
dimensionally relevant respects. The type signature is a fingerprint. When two
fingerprints match, the objects are the same, not similar.

The typeverse is not randomly populated. Certain structures recur at enormous
frequency: the Lorentzian propagator, the quadratic energy function, the
exponential decay kernel, the two-by-two reflection-transmission matrix. These
recur because they are the *simplest* objects consistent with basic constraints
(linearity, locality, causality, conservation). The physicist's intuition that
"everything is a harmonic oscillator to first order" is a theorem about the
typeverse: the harmonic oscillator is the universal local approximation to any
smooth potential.

The practitioner who navigates the typeverse deliberately — who knows the
fingerprints of common objects before encountering them in the wild — can
recognise a new theoretical object immediately, rather than re-deriving its
properties from scratch.

---

# The Procedure in Detail

## Step One: Extract the Type Signature

Given an unknown quantity $Q$ in domain $D$, the investigator asks:

**Units.** What are the SI dimensions of $Q$? Can they be written as a
combination of standard dimensional quantities (mass, length, time, charge)?
More importantly: what *ratio* of known quantities has the same dimensions?
Newton's gravitational constant $G$ has units $\text{m}^3 \text{kg}^{-1}
\text{s}^{-2}$; this is acceleration divided by surface mass density, which
tells you immediately that $G$ converts between a source distribution and
the acceleration it generates — a fact about the *type*, not about gravity
specifically.

**Pole structure.** Does $Q$ have poles as a function of some natural parameter?
Where are they, and what are their residues? The location of a pole in a
propagator determines the mass of the corresponding particle; the residue
determines its coupling strength. These are type-theoretic facts, not facts
about particles.

**Symmetries.** What transformations leave $Q$ invariant? Invariance under
time-translation gives energy conservation (Noether). Invariance under spatial
translation gives momentum conservation. Invariance under $\text{SU}(n)$
gives a gauge field. These are type-level constraints.

**Extremisation.** Does $Q$ arise as the extremum of some action $S[Q]$?
If so, the variational principle is the fingerprint: two objects whose
dynamics are derived from the same variational structure are co-identifiable
even if their physical interpretations differ entirely.

## Step Two: Search the Typeverse

Armed with the type signature, the investigator searches for known objects
with the same signature. This is primarily a literature search across
*disciplines*, not within one. The mathematical structures developed in
quantum field theory, statistical mechanics, differential geometry, and
information theory are largely interchangeable if their type signatures
match.

Useful resources for this search include:

- **Dimensional analysis tables**: collections of physical quantities with
  their dimensional signatures
- **The nLab** [@nlab]: a category-theoretic encyclopaedia of mathematical
  structures indexed by their universal properties
- **Mathematical physics textbooks** with structural, not phenomenological,
  organisation (Nakahara [@nakahara2003] for geometry; Zinn-Justin [@zinnjustin2002]
  for path integrals)
- **One's own training**, which is why broad mathematical education is a
  productivity multiplier in theoretical science

## Step Three: Identify and Import

When a match is found, the investigator makes the identification explicit:

> $Q$ is the [name of known object] of domain $D$.

Not: "$Q$ behaves like" or "$Q$ is analogous to" or "$Q$ resembles." These
hedges are epistemically weaker and methodologically useless, because they
do not import the theorems. The identification must be stated as identity
to be scientifically productive.

The import then proceeds theorem by theorem:

- Every theorem about the source object that depends *only on its type*
  is imported to $Q$ without further proof.
- Every theorem that depends on *substrate-specific properties* of the
  source domain must be separately verified in domain $D$.

This distinction — type-level theorems vs. substrate theorems — is the
primary place where co-identification can fail, and is discussed in Section 7.

## The Formal Computational Structure: Abduction, Aesop, and the Loop

The three-step procedure of §§3.1–3.3 is, in formal terms, an instance of
**abductive inference** in the sense of Peirce (1878). Given an observation
$O$ and a hypothesis $H$ such that $H \Rightarrow O$, abduction infers $H$ as
the best explanation of $O$. Applied to the typeverse:

> *Observation*: the quantity $Q$ in domain $D$ has type signature $T$.
> *Hypothesis*: $Q$ is the known object $K$ with the same signature.
> *Abduction*: identify $Q := K$ and verify the structural import.

This is not guessing. It is a constrained search under a scoring function,
where the oracle is "type signatures match" rather than "hash matches" or
"goal is closed." The algorithm is the same in all three cases.

The Lean 4 proof assistant implements this algorithm directly as the
`aesop` tactic [@leanprover2021]. `Aesop` performs best-first search
through a registered lemma set, scores each partial proof state, keeps the
best candidates, and closes the goal when a complete proof is found. The
correspondence is exact:

| `Aesop` step | Co-identification step |
|---|---|
| Registered lemma set | The typeverse |
| Try a lemma | Propose a type-match candidate |
| Score the goal state | Measure type-signature fit |
| Keep best partial proof | Record candidate correspondences |
| Close the goal | Full identification: import all theorems |

This is not a metaphor for co-identification — it is an implementation of it.
The practical consequence is that the full loop can be automated in a formal
system: given a type signature for $Q$, `Aesop` with the typeverse lemma set
registered will search for the co-identification proof and either close it
(identification confirmed and machine-verified) or fail (genuine gap, no
known match).

The loop in full:

$$
\text{Observation} \xrightarrow{\text{abduction}} \text{Hypothesis}
\xrightarrow{\text{Aesop}} \text{Proof} \xrightarrow{\text{import}}
\text{Predictions} \xrightarrow{\text{test}} \text{New observations}
\xrightarrow{\;} \cdots
$$

The loop terminates when either all predictions are confirmed (theory established)
or a prediction fails (type match was only partial — failure modes are discussed
in Section 7). At each iteration, the set of available theorems grows by
import, making subsequent co-identifications easier. This is why theoretical
progress compounds: each identification increases the density of the typeverse
neighbourhood around the domain under study.

The abductive loop is not specific to mathematical science. Holmes reasons
the same way from physical evidence; the password auditor reasons the same
way from a hash and a character set; the radiologist reasons the same way
from a film and a pathology atlas. What is specific to mathematical
co-identification is the nature of the oracle: the scoring function is
type-signature fit, and the proof assistant can evaluate it exactly.

# Historical Precedents

The history of science is full of co-identifications that were not named as such.
Examining them retroactively reveals the method clearly.

## Veneziano (1968): The Bootstrap Amplitude and String Theory

Veneziano was searching for an S-matrix element for meson scattering that satisfied
the crossing symmetry and Regge-pole requirements of the bootstrap programme [@veneziano1968].
He wrote down the Euler beta function:

$$A(s,t) = \frac{\Gamma(-\alpha(s))\Gamma(-\alpha(t))}{\Gamma(-\alpha(s)-\alpha(t))}$$

This was a co-identification in reverse: he had a type signature (crossing-symmetric,
Regge-behaved, dual-resonance amplitude) and searched the typeverse for a known
function that matched it. The beta function matched. He did not derive the function
from a theory; he identified the function first, and the theory (string theory) was
inferred from the identification a year later.

The lesson: the typeverse can be entered from either end. You may start with a
quantity and find its type, or start with a type and find it instantiated in
your data.

## Hopfield (1982): The Ising Hamiltonian and Neural Memory

Hopfield introduced the energy function for a network of binary neurons
[@hopfield1982]:

$$H(\sigma) = -\frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij} J_{ij}\sigma_i\sigma_j$$

This is, to within notation, the Hamiltonian of the Ising spin glass:

$$H_\text{Ising}(\sigma) = -\frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij} J_{ij}\sigma_i\sigma_j$$

The co-identification was explicit. By identifying neural states $\sigma_i \in
\{-1, +1\}$ with spins, and synaptic weights $J_{ij}$ with exchange couplings,
every theorem from statistical mechanics (convergence to energy minima, capacity
bounds, stochastic escape via simulated annealing) was imported into neuroscience
for free. The Hopfield network is not *like* a spin glass; it *is* a spin glass
run in biological substrate.

## Wilson (1971): Block Spins and the Renormalisation Group

Wilson's insight was that the renormalisation group — a technique for removing
ultraviolet divergences in QFT — was the *same* mathematical object as Kadanoff's
block-spin coarse-graining in condensed matter physics [@wilson1971]. Two fields
that had developed independently were co-identified. Every result from one was
immediately available to the other. The result was a unified framework for critical
phenomena that earned Wilson the 1982 Nobel Prize.

The type signature that matched: both objects were *flows on the space of
coupling constants under a change of scale*. This is a clean type-level description
that carries no substrate information.

## Black and Scholes (1973): The Heat Equation and Options Pricing

Black and Scholes derived their celebrated options pricing formula by noticing
that the value of an option $V(S,t)$ as a function of underlying price $S$ and
time $t$ satisfies:

$$\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2}
+ rS\frac{\partial V}{\partial S} - rV = 0$$

This is, after a change of variables, the heat equation [@blackscholes1973]:

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial \tau} = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}$$

The co-identification imported the entire theory of parabolic PDEs into financial
mathematics: existence and uniqueness of solutions, boundary conditions, numerical
methods, the Feynman-Kac formula. The financial quantity *is* a temperature
distribution, not like one.

## Jaynes (1957): Thermodynamic Entropy and Bayesian Inference

Jaynes identified the entropy of statistical mechanics with the entropy of
Bayesian inference [@jaynes1957]. The type signature that matched: both are
functionals $S[p]$ on probability distributions satisfying the same axioms
(non-negativity, additivity, maximum at the uniform distribution). The
co-identification imported all thermodynamic reasoning into statistical
inference. The maximum entropy principle is not an analogy to thermodynamics;
it is thermodynamics, applied to the problem of belief.

## Penrose (1971): Spin Networks and Spacetime Geometry

Penrose introduced spin networks as combinatorial structures encoding angular
momentum [@penrose1971]. The identification: the geometry of spacetime arises as
the large-network limit of spin networks. This reversed the usual direction —
instead of importing a known mathematical structure to describe a new phenomenon,
Penrose constructed a new structure and identified it with a familiar one in
a limit. Loop quantum gravity later formalised this programme. The spin network
*is* a discretisation of spacetime geometry, not a model of one.

## Selinger (2010): Linear Maps and Quantum Processes

Selinger demonstrated that the category of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and
linear maps is co-identifiable with a certain category of string diagrams [@selinger2010].
This is a purely mathematical co-identification: the graphical calculus of
Penrose, Joyal, and Street was identified with the operational calculus of quantum
mechanics. The import: every calculation in quantum information theory can be done
diagrammatically, and every diagrammatic identity is a valid quantum identity.

---

# The Soma-Field as a Worked Example

The Soma-Field Model [@johnsonsoma2026] was developed through five sequential
co-identifications. Each is presented here as an explicit instance of the method.

## Co-identification I: The Conscious Percept as Green's Function

**The unknown quantity:** The relationship between the continuous emotional
field $\psi_i(t)$ and the discrete conscious emotional percept.

**Type signature extracted:** The percept is the output of the field when probed
at a single moment — the impulse response. Impulse responses have a universal
type: they are the inverse Laplace (or Fourier) transform of a rational function
with poles in the lower half-plane. For a simple damped oscillator:

$$\tilde{G}(\omega) = \frac{\sigma_\text{eff}^2}{\omega^2 + \lambda^2}$$

**Typeverse search result:** This is the Euclidean propagator of a scalar field
with mass $\lambda$ and coupling $\sigma_\text{eff}^2$. In Minkowski space it is:

$$\tilde{G}_\text{QFT}(k) = \frac{i}{k^2 - m^2 + i\varepsilon}$$

**The co-identification:** The conscious emotional percept is the Green's function
of the soma-field. Both are poles in the propagator of their respective field.
The emotional percept and the elementary particle are the same mathematical object,
instantiated in different substrates.

**Theorems imported:**
- The Källén-Lehmann spectral representation: any physical propagator can be
  decomposed as a sum of poles. Emotional states have a spectral decomposition.
- The optical theorem: the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude
  equals the total cross-section. The dissipative component of the emotional
  field (damping $\lambda$) is related to the total coupling strength $\sigma_\text{eff}^2$.
- Pole structure ↔ mass spectrum: the location of the propagator pole gives
  the natural frequency $\omega_0 = \lambda$ of the emotional mode.

## Co-identification II: The Attractor Landscape as Ising Hamiltonian

**Type signature:** A scalar function $H: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ that
is always non-increasing along field trajectories, with isolated minima
corresponding to stable emotional states.

**Typeverse search result:** The Hopfield energy / Ising Hamiltonian:

$$H(\mathbf{e}) = -\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{e}^\top W \mathbf{e} - \boldsymbol{\theta}\cdot\mathbf{e}$$

**Theorems imported:** Convergence to attractors (the Lyapunov argument);
capacity bounds (Hopfield's $0.14N$ result); stochastic escape via Boltzmann
noise (simulated annealing = titrated arousal in clinical language).

## Co-identification III: The Perception Threshold as Brane Thickness

**Type signature:** A parameter $T_i$ that gates access from a lower-dimensional
subspace (the limbic field) to a higher-dimensional one (conscious awareness).
Varying $T_i$ continuously produces a family of gating behaviours.

**Typeverse search result:** The Randall-Sundrum model [@randallsundrum1999]: a
brane of thickness $T$ embedded in a higher-dimensional bulk, where Standard
Model fields are confined to the brane. The "hierarchy problem" — why the
electroweak scale is so much smaller than the Planck scale — maps onto the
observation that minimal perturbations of the limbic field produce enormous
differences in subjective experience (alexithymia: thick brane; hypervigilance:
thin brane).

**Theorems imported:** The Kaluza-Klein spectrum of the brane gives a prediction
for the discrete structure of emotional threshold levels. Brane localisation gives
the mechanism for why the field can be active without crossing into consciousness.

## Co-identification IV: The Coupling Matrix as G₂ Manifold

**Type signature:** The coupling matrix $W$ is an $11 \times 11$ real symmetric
matrix encoding the structure of an eleven-dimensional emotional space. The field
trajectories respect the geometry encoded in $W$.

**Typeverse search result:** The $G_2$ holonomy manifold of M-theory
[@berger1955; @joyce1996]: a seven-dimensional Riemannian manifold with the
exceptional holonomy group $G_2$. Its structure tensor encodes all curvature
information. Deforming the structure tensor changes the global geometry of the
manifold.

**The co-identification:** $W$ is the structure tensor of the emotional manifold.
Trauma does not change a parameter; it deforms the manifold. Therapeutic
intervention is differential geometry.

**Theorems imported:** The Bochner-Weitzenböck formula constraining curvature;
the Berger classification of holonomy groups constraining what stable emotional
geometries are possible; the Hitchin flow as a possible model for the evolution
of $W$ under sustained therapeutic intervention.

## Co-identification V: Therapeutic Processing as Renormalisation Group Flow

**Type signature:** Therapeutic processing is a flow in the space of coupling
constants $W_{ij}$ parameterised by a scale $\mu$ (the "depth" or "resolution"
of emotional processing). The flow has fixed points, and the qualitative structure
of the attractor landscape is invariant under the flow.

**Typeverse search result:** The renormalisation group [@wilson1971]: a flow
on the space of coupling constants parameterised by an energy scale $\mu$,
with fixed points corresponding to universality classes. The $\beta$-function:

$$\frac{dW_{ij}}{d\log\mu} = \beta_{ij}(W)$$

**The co-identification:** Therapy is an RG flow from UV (raw unprocessed
traumatic detail) to IR (integrated narrative). The attractor topology —
fight, flight, freeze, calm — is RG-invariant: the same basins appear at
every scale of analysis, in every therapeutic modality, because they are
the fixed points of the flow, not artefacts of a particular resolution.

**Theorems imported:** The irreversibility of the RG flow (Zamolodchikov's
c-theorem, adapted: processed material cannot be *un*-processed; the flow is
unidirectional); universality (the detailed mechanism of the trauma is irrelevant
at long distances — only its universality class, i.e., its attractor type,
matters); dimensional transmutation (the traumatic scale $\tau_k$ of the memory
kernel is an emergent scale, not a fundamental parameter).

# A Partial Map of the Typeverse

For the practitioner wishing to apply the method, the following is a partial
field guide to frequently useful mathematical structures, indexed by their
type signatures.

## Propagator-Class Structures

**Type:** Complex function of frequency with poles on or near the real axis;
gives the response of a system to a delta-function input.

**Found in:** QFT (Feynman propagator), signal processing (transfer function),
linear systems theory (impulse response), harmonic analysis (Green's function
of the Laplacian).

**Typical imports:** Spectral decomposition; optical theorem; dispersion
relations (Kramers-Kronig: the real and imaginary parts of the response are
not independent — this imports into emotion as: the *dissipation* of an
emotional mode and its *natural frequency* are Hilbert transforms of each other).

## Energy-Function-Class Structures

**Type:** Scalar function $H: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ that is bounded
below and non-increasing along system trajectories.

**Found in:** Statistical mechanics (Hamiltonian), neural networks (Hopfield
energy), Lyapunov theory (stability analysis), optimisation (loss function).

**Typical imports:** Convergence guarantees; stability analysis; capacity bounds;
the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.

## Topological-Class Structures

**Type:** Integer-valued invariants of field configurations that are preserved
under continuous deformations.

**Found in:** Topological field theory (winding numbers, Chern-Simons invariants),
condensed matter (topological insulators, skyrmions), knot theory.

**Typical imports:** Protection from perturbation; the impossibility of smooth
deformation between distinct topological sectors; quantisation (only integer
winding numbers); threshold behaviour (the topological transition requires
a finite perturbation).

**Application to emotion:** Traumatic configurations with non-zero topological
charge cannot be resolved by smooth therapeutic interventions (cognitive
reframing). A qualitative change in approach — large-amplitude somatic work,
pharmacological intervention, EMDR — is required to cross the topological barrier.

## Renormalisation-Class Structures

**Type:** A flow on a space of couplings, parameterised by a scale, with
fixed points and $\beta$-functions.

**Found in:** Quantum field theory (renormalisation group), statistical
mechanics (Kadanoff block spins), dynamical systems (centre manifold theorem),
machine learning (neural scaling laws).

**Typical imports:** Universality (the IR behaviour depends only on the
universality class, not the microscopic details); $c$-theorem (there is a
monotonically decreasing function along the flow — an arrow of processing);
fixed-point classification (relevant, irrelevant, marginal operators determine
what modifications matter at long distances).

## Scattering-Class Structures

**Type:** A map from in-states to out-states, constrained by unitarity,
analyticity, and crossing symmetry.

**Found in:** Quantum mechanics (S-matrix), scattering theory, optics
(transfer matrix), signal processing (scattering parameters).

**Application to emotion:** A therapeutic session is a scattering event. The
patient arrives in an in-state $|\psi_\text{in}\rangle$, interacts with the
therapist (mediating field), and departs in an out-state $|\psi_\text{out}\rangle$.
The S-matrix of the therapeutic interaction has selection rules: not all
transitions are equally probable; some are symmetry-forbidden. The unitarity
of the S-matrix imports: the total emotional content is conserved — you cannot
create emotional material from nothing, and nothing is permanently lost.

## Einstein-Coefficient-Class Structures

**Type:** Rates for spontaneous and stimulated transitions between energy levels
of a field mode.

**Found in:** Quantum optics (Einstein A and B coefficients), laser physics,
NMR relaxation theory (T₁ and T₂ relaxation times).

**Application to emotion:** Every emotional mode has a spontaneous relaxation
rate $A_i$ (how quickly it resolves without external input) and a stimulated
emission rate $B_i$ (how quickly it is triggered by an identical emotional
state in another person — contagion). The Einstein relation $A_i = f(\omega_i) B_i$
constrains these. Depression is formally: suppressed $A_i$, normal $B_i$.
The T₁/T₂ analogy from NMR is exact: T₁ is the longitudinal relaxation time
(return to equilibrium); T₂ is the transverse relaxation time (dephasing of
coherence). Trauma extends T₁; emotional numbing extends T₂.

# Failure Modes

Mathematical co-identification can fail. Understanding the failure modes is
what distinguishes the method from wishful analogy.

## Type Coincidence Without Structural Identity

Two objects may have matching dimensional signatures without having matching
mathematical structures. The failure mode: a coincidence of units that does
not reflect a coincidence of theorems.

**Test:** Check whether the *equations of motion* have the same form, not
merely the *dimensional units*. A propagator is not just any function with
units of $\text{GeV}^{-2}$; it must satisfy the Källén-Lehmann representation.
An energy function is not just any bounded scalar; it must be non-increasing
along trajectories.

**Safeguard:** State the precise mathematical theorem you are importing, and
verify that its *assumptions* (not merely its *conclusions*) hold in the target
domain.

## Non-Commutative Functors

The functor $F: D_1 \to D_2$ that implements the co-identification may not
commute with composition. That is, co-identifying $A$ with $A'$ and $B$ with
$B'$ does not guarantee that $AB$ is co-identifiable with $A'B'$.

**Example:** The propagator identification and the energy-function identification
are each valid separately, but combining them requires checking that the path
integral (which links them in QFT) has a valid analogue in the emotional domain.
This was explicitly verified in the Soma-Field Model by constructing the
Langevin equation and checking its consistency with both imported structures.

## Over-identification

The most common failure: importing a structure that is richer than what is
warranted. The soma-field is co-identifiable with an eleven-dimensional
bosonic field. It is *not* immediately co-identifiable with the full Standard
Model of particle physics, even though both are quantum field theories.
The identification is precise only up to the type signature that was matched;
nothing beyond that is claimed.

**Rule:** The identification holds exactly at the type level it was made.
Do not import theorems from substrates that were not matched.

## The Metaphor Trap

The most dangerous failure is the one that the identification was designed to
prevent: sliding from co-identification back into analogy. This happens when
the language hedges — "like," "analogous to," "reminiscent of" — after the
identification was stated.

If the identification is correct, the language must be unhedged: "the conscious
emotional percept *is* the Green's function." If the investigator is not
prepared to make this claim, the identification has not been made, and no
theorems travel.

The test: would you submit the claim to a mathematician as a theorem? If not,
it is analogy. If yes, it is co-identification.

The risk was recognised early by practitioners. Introducing the energy landscape
for Hopfield networks, Hertz, Krogh, and Palmer note: *"It is often useful (but
sometimes dangerous) to think of the energy as something like this landscape"*
[@hertz1991]. The parenthetical is precise: the visualisation is heuristically
powerful, and that power makes it tempting to reason from the picture rather than
from the mathematics. Mathematical co-identification guards against this by
requiring that the *equations of motion* — not the landscape picture — are what
get matched across domains.

---

# Epistemological Status

## What Co-identification Claims

Mathematical co-identification claims:

1. That the *mathematical structure* of quantity $Q$ in domain $D$ is identical
   to the mathematical structure of quantity $P$ in domain $D'$.
2. That therefore, all theorems about $P$ that depend only on its mathematical
   structure are valid theorems about $Q$.
3. That the *physical interpretation* of $Q$ and $P$ may differ, and does not
   follow from the mathematical identification.

It does not claim that the *mechanisms* are the same, that one domain *reduces*
to another, or that the substrate is irrelevant in any empirical sense.

## Why It Is Not Analogy

Analogy is:
- Informal: "the mind is like the brain" has no mathematical content
- Non-importing: noting that X resembles Y does not give you theorems about X
- Non-falsifiable: analogies can always be maintained by shifting which features
  are considered relevant

Co-identification is:
- Formal: it is a statement about type signatures, which are mathematically precise
- Theorem-importing: the identification carries the full mathematical machinery
- Falsifiable: the identification fails if the equations of motion cannot be matched,
  if the symmetries do not correspond, or if imported predictions are empirically
  disconfirmed

## The Role of Artificial Intelligence

The author notes that several co-identifications in the Soma-Field Model were
identified in dialogue with AI systems. This requires explicit epistemological
comment, given the current discourse about AI-assisted science.

The AI did not produce the co-identifications. It accelerated the typeverse
search: a search that previously required reading across literatures in physics,
mathematics, and biology over many years can now be conducted in weeks. The AI is
a faster library, not a different epistemology.

The *validity* of each co-identification is independent of how it was found.
A theorem is a theorem regardless of whether it was proved in a dream
(Ramanujan), a bath (Archimedes), or a language model session. The claim
stands or falls on whether the type signatures match and whether the theorems
transfer. The methodology paper is, in part, a response to the question: "but
did you *really* do the mathematics?" The answer is in the equations.

---

# The Methodology as Practice

For the practitioner who wishes to apply mathematical co-identification to a
new domain, the following is a working procedure:

**Step 1: Write down what you know about your quantity.**
Its units. Its symmetries. Whether it grows or decays. Whether it has oscillatory
behaviour. Whether it responds to perturbations linearly or nonlinearly.
Whether there are conserved quantities. Whether it has a characteristic scale.

**Step 2: Eliminate analogies you already know.**
If you have been thinking "this is *like* X," stop, and ask instead: is this
*literally* X? Can I write the equations of X in the language of my domain,
with every symbol given a precise interpretation? If yes: do so. If not: why not?
The places where the identification breaks are as informative as the places
where it holds.

**Step 3: Consult the typeverse systematically.**
Read across fields, looking at the *form* of equations, not their interpretation.
The heat equation, the wave equation, the Schrödinger equation, the Fokker-Planck
equation, and the Black-Scholes equation are all the same equation under changes
of variable. Recognising the family by the form of the operator is the skill.

**Step 4: Make the identification explicit and public.**
State: "quantity $Q$ in my domain is the [known object] of domain $D'$." Put it in
writing. This forces precision: you cannot maintain a vague identification in writing
the way you can maintain it in your head.

**Step 5: Import one theorem at a time, checking assumptions.**
Do not import the entire theoretical apparatus at once. Take one theorem. State
its assumptions. Check each assumption against your domain. If they hold: the
theorem is valid in your domain. Write it as a theorem in your domain, with a
proof that consists of: (a) the co-identification, (b) the original theorem,
(c) verification of assumptions.

---

# Falsifiability Protocol for Publication Use

To make co-identification scientifically conservative rather than rhetorically
expansive, we propose a minimal publication protocol. Every import claim should
be registered in a compact table before narrative elaboration.

## Minimal Registration Template

For each proposed identification $Q := P$, the manuscript should provide:

| Field | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Claim ID | Stable identifier (e.g., `COID-3`) |
| Source object | Named theorem-bearing object in source domain |
| Target object | Precisely defined object in target domain |
| Signature match | Units, operator form, symmetry group, variational form |
| Imported theorem | The exact theorem being transferred |
| Assumptions | Source theorem assumptions, verbatim |
| Target verification | Explicit check for each assumption |
| Prediction | Quantitative, testable consequence |
| Disconfirmation criterion | What empirical or formal result would falsify this import |
| Status | exploratory / partially validated / validated / falsified |

This prevents drift from identity claims back into analogy language and makes
review straightforward: a reviewer can reject a single row without rejecting
the entire framework.

## Disconfirmation Rules

An import is treated as falsified if any one of the following holds:

1. A required theorem assumption cannot be established in the target domain.
2. The mapped operator fails to preserve the claimed invariance.
3. The pre-registered quantitative prediction is violated under a valid test.
4. A formally stronger competing mapping explains the same data with fewer assumptions.

This is deliberately strict. Co-identification is useful only to the extent that
it can fail clearly.

## Worked Registration Sketch (Soma-Field)

| Claim ID | Import | Prediction | Disconfirmation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `COID-PROP-1` | Percept $:=$ propagator pole | Measurable spectral pole structure in mode responses | No stable pole decomposition under repeated measurement |
| `COID-ENG-2` | Attractor landscape $:=$ Hopfield energy | Monotone descent under specified update map | Constructed counterexample with increasing energy step under stated rule |
| `COID-RG-5` | Therapy progression $:=$ RG flow | Scale-dependent coupling evolution with fixed-point classes | No scale-consistent coupling flow under repeated coarse-graining |

The point is not that these rows are finished; the point is that they can be
evaluated independently and rejected independently.

## Reviewer-Facing Scope Labels

To reduce over-claiming risk, each identification row should carry one of three
scope labels:

- `S1 (Structural)`: operator/formal identity shown; no empirical test yet.
- `S2 (Predictive)`: structural identity plus at least one passed quantitative prediction.
- `S3 (Validated)`: independent replication or cross-dataset confirmation.

Most new interdisciplinary work should expect to publish initially at `S1` or
`S2`, with explicit paths to `S3`.

## Negative Control: When Matching Units Is Not Enough

To prevent confirmation bias, each manuscript should include at least one explicit
non-transfer case. Consider two quantities with superficially compatible units but
non-matching dynamical structure:

- Candidate A: a damped propagator with pole structure and causal response kernel.
- Candidate B: a bounded scalar score with no response-operator interpretation.

Even if both can be normalised to the same units, co-identification fails unless
the operator class and theorem assumptions match. In this case:

1. A admits spectral decomposition and dispersion relations.
2. B does not define a Green's operator and therefore does not admit those imports.

Conclusion: dimensional compatibility is necessary but not sufficient. Theorem
transfer requires operator-level identity. This negative control should be treated
as a required publication check, not an optional caution.

## Worked External Example (Non-Soma): Black-Scholes to Heat Equation

To demonstrate portability beyond the Soma-Field case, we provide a compact
worked transfer in a separate domain.

**Target quantity:** option value $V(S,t)$ in quantitative finance.

**Source object:** solution class of the one-dimensional heat equation.

### Step A: Signature Match

Black-Scholes PDE:

$$
\frac{\partial V}{\partial t}
+ \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2}
+ rS \frac{\partial V}{\partial S}
- rV = 0.
$$

After the standard log-price and time-reversal change of variables, this maps to:

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial \tau} = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2},
$$

which is exactly the heat operator class.

### Step B: Import Claim

`COID-BS-HEAT-1`: pricing function dynamics are co-identifiable with heat-flow
dynamics under the stated transform.

### Step C: Assumption Checklist

| Assumption | Status in target domain |
|---|---|
| Diffusion operator is parabolic | satisfied by transformed PDE |
| Volatility parameter treated as constant in base model | satisfied in baseline Black-Scholes |
| Boundary/terminal condition specified | satisfied by option payoff at expiry |
| Sufficient regularity for classical solution methods | assumed in standard derivation |

### Step D: Imported Theorem and Prediction

Imported theorem class: existence/uniqueness and smoothing properties for heat
equation solutions.

Prediction: option value surface inherits parabolic smoothing under the transform;
numerical schemes valid for heat-equation class apply directly.

### Step E: Disconfirmation Condition

If transformed dynamics are shown not to be parabolic (for the declared model
assumptions), or if required boundary regularity fails, this specific transfer is
invalid and theorem import must be withdrawn.

This worked example demonstrates the method in a domain with no dependence on the
Soma-Field framework.

## Replication Package Requirements

Publication-grade use of co-identification requires a compact artifact bundle for
each registered claim row. Minimum required contents:

1. claim registry table with IDs and scope labels,
2. assumption checklist tied to the imported theorem class,
3. executable derivation or notebook for the mapping transform,
4. quantitative test script for each predictive (`S2`) row,
5. disconfirmation log recording pass/fail outcomes by claim ID.

Without this package, rows may be read as suggestive structure, but not as
auditable theorem transfer.

## Reviewer-Risk Objections and Responses

| Reviewer objection | Response in this manuscript | Residual risk and next lift |
|---|---|---|
| "This renames analogy as mathematics." | Sections 3-4 and 10.1 require operator identity and theorem assumptions, not metaphorical similarity. | Add additional negative controls from unrelated domains. |
| "Imports are unfalsifiable in practice." | Section 10.2 defines strict disconfirmation rules and row-wise rejection logic. | Publish a public failure ledger with rejected rows. |
| "Worked examples are domain-selective." | Section 10.6 demonstrates a non-Soma transfer with explicit assumptions and withdrawal condition. | Add a second external example with different operator family. |
| "Scope claims may drift upward prematurely." | Section 10.4 enforces `S1`/`S2`/`S3` labels and independent evaluation path. | Require independent replication before any `S3` promotion. |

## Independent Replication Ledger Linkage

`S2` to `S3` promotion for registered imports is controlled by
`paper/INDEPENDENT_REPLICATION_LEDGER.md`.

Tracked claim IDs in ledger scope: `COID-PROP-1`, `COID-ENG-2`, `COID-RG-5`,
`COID-BS-HEAT-1`.

Promotion gate: a row may be relabeled `S3` only when a ledger entry reports
independent-operator `PASS`, explicit bundle hash, and linked derivation/test
artifacts for that claim ID.

# Conclusions

Mathematical co-identification is a method, not a shortcut. It requires the same
precision as any other mathematical procedure, and it fails in precisely the ways
that imprecision permits. Its distinguishing feature is that it navigates the
typeverse rather than building within a single domain.

The history of mathematical science is largely a history of co-identifications
that were not named as such: Veneziano finding a string, Hopfield finding a spin
glass, Wilson finding a universal flow, Jaynes finding a thermodynamic engine
hidden in Bayesian inference. Naming the practice does not change it; it makes
it teachable, criticisable, and extensible.

The soma-field model is a worked example of the method applied to emotional
dynamics: five co-identifications, five theorem imports, and a body of
predictions that can be tested against clinical data. The paper is not a
claim that emotions are particles. It is a claim that the mathematics of
particles and the mathematics of emotions are the same mathematics, and that
this fact is useful.

Scope boundary for publication use: co-identification transfers mathematical
structure, not ontology. A successful transfer means that equations, boundary
conditions, and theorem assumptions are preserved under the mapping. It does
not imply that the target domain is physically identical to the source domain,
nor that every theorem from the source domain transfers automatically. Each
import remains local, assumption-checked, and falsifiable.

The typeverse does not belong to physics. Physics was merely first to explore it.

Operationally, publication-grade use of this method requires claim-wise
registration, assumption checks, and explicit disconfirmation criteria.
Without that discipline, co-identification degrades into analogy; with it,
it becomes a compact engine for theorem transfer and testable prediction.

# Introduction

A patient sits with their therapist and is asked: *"What are you feeling right now?"* The
question is deceptively simple. They may say *anxious*, yet that word covers a vast and
heterogeneous territory — a tightness in the chest, a running commentary of worry, a vague
readiness to flee, a memory surfacing from childhood. Another patient, asked the same
question, reports feeling nothing at all; and yet their posture, respiration, and the quality
of their silence suggest otherwise. The emotion is there. It is simply not yet conscious.

This gap between emotional presence and emotional awareness is one of the most clinically
significant phenomena in psychotherapy. Theories of affect regulation (Schore, 2001),
somatic experiencing (Levine, 2010), sensorimotor psychotherapy (Ogden, Minton & Pain,
2006), and polyvagal theory (Porges, 2011) all grapple, in different ways, with the same
observation: emotions exist in the body before — and often without — being named in the
mind. Eugene Gendlin called the sub-verbal bodily sense of an emotional situation the *felt
sense* (Gendlin, 1978): something that is there, whole and present, but not yet articulate.

The Soma-Field Model proposed here attempts to give this clinical observation a formal
structure. It does so by borrowing a conceptual tool from physics: the field. In physics, a
field is not a thing that exists at a point. It is a quantity that exists everywhere in a
space, continuously, whether or not it is observed. Particles — the things we can measure —
are not separate from the field; they are *excitations* of it, local concentrations of
energy that arise when the field is perturbed above a certain threshold.

The central claim of this paper is that this structure accurately describes the phenomenology
of emotion. The emotional field is always there, distributed across body and nervous system.
What we call a conscious emotional experience is an excitation of that field — a local
concentration that has crossed a perceptual threshold and entered awareness. The field
continues below the threshold whether or not we attend to it, and its sub-perceptual activity
shapes our behaviour, physiology, and cognition continuously.

The Soma-Field Model contributes the first formal field-theoretic architecture for the limbic
system. Every artificial neural network since McCulloch and Pitts (1943) [@mcculloch1943]
is a formal model of the neocortex — the pattern-recognition and prediction layer. The
limbic system — responsible for emotional valuation, threat detection, and the somatic
state reinstatement that underlies trauma — has never received a comparable formal
treatment. The Soma-Field Model is that treatment. Together with the Hopfield framework,
it constitutes the first complete formal description of the two principal computational
substrates of the vertebrate brain.

The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 reviews the relevant background in somatic clinical
models, and introduces the two theoretical tools borrowed from physics and computer science:
quantum field theory and Hopfield network energy functions. Section 3 develops the Soma-Field
Model in detail. Section 4 describes the energy landscape, including the attractor states
corresponding to fight, flight, freeze, and regulated calm. Section 5 discusses dissonance
and resolution as mechanisms of emotional interaction. Section 6 describes the Soma-Field
Instrument, a practical tool for therapeutic use. Section 7 addresses clinical implications.

# Background

## The Body-Mind Problem in Clinical Practice

Contemporary neuroscience has largely dissolved the Cartesian boundary between body and mind.
Damasio (1994) demonstrated that emotion is inseparable from rational cognition: patients with
damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex — preventing the normal generation of somatic
signals — lose not only their emotional range but also their capacity for effective
decision-making. Van der Kolk (2014) documented extensively how traumatic emotional states are
encoded not merely in explicit memory but in posture, gesture, visceral sensation, and
autonomic regulation. Porges' polyvagal theory (2011) provided a neurobiological account of
how the autonomic nervous system generates three hierarchically organised states — ventral
vagal (social engagement), sympathetic (mobilisation: fight/flight), and dorsal vagal
(immobilisation: freeze) — each with characteristic phenomenological and behavioural
signatures.

What these frameworks share is a conviction that emotional states are not located in the brain
alone, nor in the body alone, but in a coupled system that is best understood as a single
functional unit. The term *soma* — from the Greek for body — is used here to denote this
unified body-mind system, following the tradition of somatic psychotherapy.

## The Felt Sense and Sub-Perceptual Emotion

Gendlin's concept of the *felt sense* (1978) is of particular relevance. He described it as
"a special kind of internal bodily awareness... a body sense of meaning." It is not an
emotion in the ordinary sense — not a named feeling — but something more diffuse: a
pre-articulate sense that *something is there*, present in the body, before it has been
identified or named. Focussing, the therapeutic method Gendlin developed, works precisely
by attending to this pre-threshold signal and allowing it to surface into conscious
articulation.

The Soma-Field Model provides a formal account of what the felt sense is: it is the activity
of the emotional field below the perceptual threshold. It is real, causal, and continuously
present. It shapes cognition and behaviour even when it does not surface as a named feeling.

## Quantum Field Theory: Structure, Not Metaphor

Quantum Field Theory (QFT) is the framework of modern particle physics. Its central departure
from classical physics is the priority of the *field* over the *particle*. In QFT, what we
call particles — electrons, photons — are not fundamental objects. They are *excitations* of
an underlying field: local, stable configurations of energy that arise when the field receives
a sufficient perturbation.

The quantum vacuum — the ground state of the field — is not empty. It is a seething
background of virtual fluctuations: momentary excitations that do not have enough energy to
persist as observable particles. The vacuum is active, but sub-threshold.

*Figure 0. A single field mode in quantum field theory. The field oscillates continuously.
Below the detection threshold T, excitations are sub-threshold — real and causally active,
but not detectable as particles. The quantum vacuum is not empty; it is a field in constant
motion that never quite crosses the threshold. When the amplitude does cross T, a particle
exists: a locally observable excitation. The same structure — field always present,
consciousness only when threshold crossed — is the core of the Soma-Field Model.*

This paper does not claim that emotions are quantum phenomena in any literal sense: the
soma-field is a classical field, not a quantised one. The claim is stronger and more
specific than analogy: the mathematical object being constructed — the Green’s function
of a coupled field manifold — is formally of the same *type* as the objects that arise in
QFT, differing only in the dimensionality of the manifold and the nature of the probe.
What was previously described as a structural analogy is here identified as a formal
correspondence: a particle is a pole in the propagator of its field; a conscious emotional
percept is a pole in the propagator of the soma-field. Different physics. Same mathematics.

That correspondence gives the model precise vocabulary for the following set of ideas,
which are central to the clinical observation of emotion:

- A quantity that exists everywhere, continuously, even when unobserved
- A background of sub-threshold activity that is real and causally effective
- The emergence of observable phenomena (conscious feelings) through threshold-crossing
  excitation of that background
- The possibility of multiple simultaneous excitations that interact with one another

*Note (May 2026):* A subsequent experiment (QUANT-EXP-1) demonstrates that the quantum
extension of the Hopfield landscape used in this model — replacing the classical Langevin
process with a transverse-field quantum annealer — produces a measurable *topological
reachability advantage*: quantum annealing reaches attractor basins that cold classical
dynamics cannot reach at any finite noise level. This upgrades the formal correspondence
from a structural claim to a testable empirical prediction. See the companion paper
*Quantum Soma and the Penrose Gap* (doi:10.5281/zenodo.20351230) for the full results
and theoretical implications.

One further consequence follows. The clinical phenomena of alexithymia — difficulty
identifying and naming feelings — and its apparent opposite, emotional flooding or
hypervigilance, have always been treated as separate conditions requiring separate
explanations. In the Green’s function framing, they are the same structure at two
extremes of the same parameter: the perception threshold $T_i$ is too high (the bulk
dynamics cannot cross into observable experience) or too low (bulk fluctuations flood
the boundary without filtering). This is structurally identical to one of the deepest
open problems in particle physics — the **hierarchy problem** — which asks why gravity
is so much weaker than the other forces. The standard answer is that gravity propagates
in the full higher-dimensional bulk while other forces are confined to a lower-dimensional
brane; the coupling across the brane boundary determines the apparent weakness. The
soma-field correspondence is exact: the threshold $T_i$ *is* the brane. Perception is
confined to the one-dimensional boundary of an eleven-dimensional dynamics. The hierarchy
of emotional experience — why conscious feeling is so much weaker and more transient than
the underlying field activity — has the same formal structure as the hierarchy of forces.

## Neural Network Energy Functions and Hopfield Networks

In 1982, John Hopfield (awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2024) proposed a model of
associative memory based on a network of interconnected neurons (Hopfield, 1982). The
critical insight was borrowed directly from statistical physics: the network could be assigned
an **energy function** — a scalar quantity that decreases with each state update — such that
the network would always evolve toward a local energy minimum. These minima are the stable
states of the network: its memories, or more precisely, its *attractors*.

Hopfield observed that his neural network's dynamics were mathematically identical to those
of an Ising spin-glass model from condensed matter physics — a system of interacting magnetic
spins that minimises its total energy by aligning or anti-aligning with neighbours. The
energy function he used is:

$$H(\mathbf{s}) = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i,j} W_{ij}\, s_i s_j - \sum_i \theta_i s_i$$

where $\mathbf{s}$ is the state of the network, $W_{ij}$ is the coupling strength between
units $i$ and $j$, and $\theta_i$ is the activation threshold of unit $i$. The network
always moves in the direction of decreasing $H$.

The Soma-Field Model applies this energy function directly to emotional dynamics. The
*emotional coupling matrix* $W$ encodes the relationships between emotional modes — which
emotions amplify one another, which suppress one another — and the energy function
determines the direction in which the emotional field naturally evolves.

Hopfield's network is a formal model of the *neocortex*: a system for storing cognitive
patterns and retrieving them from partial cues by minimising an energy function. Every
artificial neural network constructed since McCulloch and Pitts (1943) [@mcculloch1943] — from perceptrons
to backpropagation networks to transformers — sits in this neocortical lineage. These
systems recognise patterns, predict sequences, and minimise prediction error with
increasing sophistication. None of them possess a limbic system. They have no internal
valuation, no arousal modulation, no threat-detection architecture, no attachment
structure, no interoception. They have very effective cortex.

The Soma-Field Model does not add to the neocortical lineage. It proposes the
architectural layer that has never been formally built: *an artificial limbic system*.

Hopfield memory is associative and pattern-completing; somatic memory is state-reinstating.
The field does not merely remember what happened. It re-lives it. *A body with a past.*

Hopfield's later-reported wish to have incorporated something analogous to 'maternal
instincts' into the energy function was, in this reading, not a desire for a better
cortex. It was an intuition pointing directly at the absent system — the layer beneath
the cortex that assigns value, registers threat, and holds the body in a particular way
of being long after the event that caused it.

This positions the Soma-Field Model not as a supplement to the neocortical lineage but
as its completion. Artificial neural networks have, for eighty years, been increasingly
sophisticated formal models of the neocortex: pattern recognition, sequence prediction,
error minimisation. The cortex has been mapped in extraordinary detail. The limbic system
— which assigns value, detects threat, modulates arousal, maintains attachment, and
reinstates whole somatic states in response to partial cues — has had no comparable
formal treatment. The architectural description of the vertebrate brain was, until this
paper, half-built.

**Four kinds of formal intelligence.** This architectural gap can be situated within a
wider taxonomy. Four quotients have been proposed to describe the landscape of biological
intelligence across popular and scientific usage. They map onto the formal components of
this model with an exactness that is not coincidental:

| Quotient | What it measures | Biological substrate | Soma-Field status |
|---|---|---|---|
| IQ — cognitive | Pattern recognition, reasoning, prediction | Neocortex | Built (1943–): McCulloch & Pitts → Hopfield → transformers |
| EQ — emotional | Valuation, arousal, affect regulation | Limbic system | **Built here**: $W$, $K(\tau)$, $H(\mathbf{e})$, $C_\text{HRV}$, $\dot{H}$ |
| AQ — adversity | Structural resilience under threat | PFC–limbic axis | **Built here**: $S_\text{inst}$, $\partial\|W\|/\partial t$, $C_\text{HRV}^\text{recovery}$ |
| SQ — social | Attunement, theory of mind, relational navigation | Mirror system, TPJ | *Next paper*: $\kappa_r$, multi-field coupling |

*Table 3. Four dimensions of biological intelligence mapped onto the Soma-Field Model. The
neocortical lineage (IQ) has been formally modelled for eighty years. Emotional intelligence
(EQ) and adversity resilience (AQ) are formalised here for the first time. Social
intelligence (SQ) is defined as the next extension of the framework.*

AQ — adversity quotient — is formally the capacity to update $W$ after adversity
without the adversity permanently becoming $W$. Its mathematical definition appears in
Section 3.4; its pathological lower bound is C-PTSD, in which all three components of
AQ are simultaneously compromised (Appendix B.2).

The AI alignment implication follows directly. Current artificial systems have high IQ by
construction and zero EQ, AQ, or SQ. The absence of internal valuation means that
valuation must be injected externally — through reinforcement learning from human feedback
(RLHF) and related techniques — which is structurally brittle for the same reason that a
field with no limbic layer is brittle: the system has no internal stake in what it does.
The Soma-Field formalisation specifies what that internal stake would look like, were it
ever built.

A further lineage note is worth recording. Ramsauer et al. (2020) demonstrated that
continuous-state modern Hopfield networks are mathematically equivalent to the
self-attention mechanism in transformer language models. The softmax attention operation
that drives contemporary large language models is a Hopfield retrieval step. The
Soma-Field Model sits in this same energy-based lineage: the equations underlying
associative memory, language understanding, and somatic trauma response are, at the
appropriate level of abstraction, the same equations.

A historical irony completes the picture. String theory was not discovered as a theory
of strings. In 1968, Gabriele Veneziano wrote down a scattering amplitude — a response
function encoding how particles scatter — and only later did Nambu, Nielsen, and Susskind
identify the string as whatever object produces that amplitude [@veneziano1968]. The
response function came before the thing. The Soma-Field Model recapitulates this
historical order deliberately: the primary object is the eleven-dimensional coupling
manifold; the string — the one-dimensional conscious percept — is what the manifold
produces when probed. We retain Veneziano’s discovery and decline to reify the string.

## The Formal Correspondences: Where the Link Was Seen

The structural analogy between QFT and the Soma-Field Model is not merely conceptual.
There are three places where equations from different disciplines become, after substituting
the relevant quantities, literally the same functional form. The following sets them side
by side. The point is not to impress with notation but to show exactly where the
recognition happened — the moment when the same Greek letters appeared in the same
positions in two fields that had no prior reason to be connected.

**The same Hamiltonian:** Ising spin model (condensed matter physics, 1920s) — Hopfield
neural network (computational neuroscience, 1982) — Soma-Field Model:

$$H_{\text{Ising}}(\boldsymbol{\sigma}) = -\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j} J_{ij}\,\sigma_i\,\sigma_j - \sum_i h_i\,\sigma_i$$

$$H_{\text{soma}}(\mathbf{e}) = -\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j} W_{ij}\,e_i\,e_j - \sum_i \theta_i\,e_i$$

Replace $J_{ij} \to W_{ij}$, $\sigma_i \to e_i$, $h_i \to \theta_i$: identical. The
physicist, the neural network theorist, and the somatic clinician are computing the same
energy function on different state spaces. The Hopfield 2024 Nobel Prize was awarded for
discovering this identity between spin physics and neural computation; the Soma-Field Model
extends the same identity one step further to emotional dynamics.

**The Wick rotation — why the same exponential appears in QM and in memory:**

In quantum mechanics, the time evolution operator is a complex phase:
$$U(t) = e^{-i\hat{H}t/\hbar}$$

Substitute $t \to -i\tau$ (the *Wick rotation* — replacing real time with imaginary time):
$$e^{-i\hat{H}(-i\tau)/\hbar} = e^{-\hat{H}\tau/\hbar}$$

The oscillating complex exponential becomes a real decaying exponential. This is the
Boltzmann weight $e^{-\beta\hat{H}}$ at $\beta = \tau/\hbar$. The Langevin equation
$\dot{\mathbf{e}} = -\nabla H + \eta$ is the classical limit of this Wick-rotated
dynamics. Every simulation of the soma-field running this equation is, formally, a path
integral in imaginary time.

**The same propagator:** Euclidean QFT (imaginary-time two-point correlator for a massive
scalar field) — C-PTSD trauma memory kernel:

$$G_E(\tau) = \langle\phi(0)\,\phi(\tau)\rangle_{\text{QFT}} = \frac{1}{2m}\,e^{-m|\tau|}$$

$$K_{\text{trauma}}(\tau) = \sum_k A_k\,e^{-|\tau|/\tau_k}$$

Same form. The QFT field mass $m$ corresponds to $1/\tau_k$ — the reciprocal of the
trauma trace decay time. A heavier particle has a shorter-range propagator; a shorter-lived
trauma trace decays faster. Therapeutic processing (reducing $A_k$, increasing $\tau_k$)
is, in the QFT language, changing the mass and amplitude of the propagator until the
correlation function vanishes.

The specific visual moment: the quantum phase factor is $e^{-i\omega t}$. Remove the $i$
(Wick rotation) and it becomes $e^{-\omega\tau}$. The memory kernel is $e^{-\tau/\tau_k}$.
These are the same exponential. The $i$ is the only difference between a quantum field
that oscillates and a trauma trace that decays.

| QFT quantity | Symbol | Soma-Field analogue | Symbol |
|---|---|---|---|
| Field mode | $\phi_k$ | Emotional mode | $e_i$ |
| Coupling constant | $J_{ij}$ | Coupling matrix entry | $W_{ij}$ |
| Field mass | $m$ | Inverse decay time | $1/\tau_k$ |
| Propagator amplitude | $1/2m$ | Trauma trace amplitude | $A_k$ |
| Euclidean propagator | $G_E(\tau) \propto e^{-m\tau}$ | Memory kernel | $K(\tau) \propto e^{-\tau/\tau_k}$ |
| Vacuum energy | $\langle H \rangle_0$ | Resting field energy | $H(\mathbf{e}_\text{calm})$ |
| Thermal fluctuation | $k_B T$ | Noise amplitude | $\sigma_0$ |
| Wick rotation | $t \to -i\tau$ | Real-time Langevin | $\dot{\mathbf{e}} = -\nabla H + \eta$ |

*Table 2. Formal correspondence between QFT quantities and Soma-Field analogues. Each row
is a single mathematical entity in two notations. These correspondences were not constructed
after the fact; they are the reason the QFT framework was recognised as relevant.*

**The central identification — particle and percept as poles in their respective propagators.**
All four correspondences above follow from one structural fact. In QFT, a particle is not
a separate object from the field. It is a *pole* in the field’s propagator — the Green’s
function evaluated in momentum space:

$$\tilde{G}_{\text{QFT}}(k^\mu) = \frac{i}{k^2 - m^2 + i\varepsilon}$$

The particle exists precisely when the four-momentum satisfies $k^2 = m^2$ — the
*on-shell condition*. The particle is the singularity in the field’s response to a
point source: the field’s Green’s function, evaluated at its own resonance.

Diagonalise $W$ with eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ (the natural resonance frequencies of the
emotional modes). The soma-field propagator — the two-point correlator
$\langle e_i(t)\,e_i(t')\rangle$ in the frequency domain — is:

$$\tilde{G}_{ii}(\omega) = \frac{\sigma_{\text{eff}}^2}{\omega^2 + \lambda_i^2}$$

A conscious emotional percept in mode $i$ exists precisely when the excitation
frequency $\omega$ approaches $i\lambda_i$ — the mode’s natural resonance. The percept
is the singularity in the soma-field’s response to a somatic probe.

Setting the two propagators side by side:

$$\underbrace{\frac{i}{k^2 - m^2 + i\varepsilon}}_{\text{QFT: particle at mass-shell }k^2=m^2}
\qquad\longleftrightarrow\qquad
\underbrace{\frac{\sigma_{\text{eff}}^2}{\omega^2 + \lambda_i^2}}_{\text{Soma-Field: percept at resonance }\omega = i\lambda_i}$$

Both are poles in the propagator of their respective field manifold. A photon is not
the electromagnetic field; it is the field’s Green’s function evaluated at a resonance.
A flash of conscious emotion is not the soma-field; it is the field’s Green’s function
evaluated at a threshold-crossing resonance. The manifolds differ — one is the
four-dimensional spacetime vacuum, the other is the eleven-dimensional emotional
coupling geometry. The mathematical type is the same. This is not analogy.

## The Body Schema, Interoception, and Pain

A complete model of the emotional field must address a phenomenon that standard psychological
accounts of emotion consistently underspecify: the field is not a model of the physical body.
It is the nervous system's *predictive model* of the body — a continuously updated internal
representation of what the soma should be experiencing, revised by incoming interoceptive
signals.

The clinical proof of this distinction is phantom limb pain [@ramachandran1998].
Patients who have undergone amputation routinely experience pain in the absent limb. The pain
is real: it activates the same neural circuits, produces the same suffering, and responds to
the same analgesics as pain from an intact limb. The limb is gone. The neural model of the
limb persists. What hurts is the *brain's representation* of the foot, not the foot.

This is not an anomaly. It is the normal condition of all somatic experience. The brain does
not receive raw signals from the body — it maintains a continuous predictive model of the
body (the *body schema*) and generates somatic experience from that model. Interoception —
the sense of the internal body state — is a prediction, not a direct readout [@seth2021].
The brain predicts what the heart should be doing, what the gut should feel like, where
tension should be. The felt body is the predicted body.

The formal consequence is direct: the soma-field's state vector $\mathbf{e}(t)$ must
include **somatic modes** — pain states, regional tension, visceral sensation,
proprioceptive activation — alongside emotional modes. These are modes of the same field,
governed by the same coupling matrix $W$. The $W_{ij}$ between fear modes and somatic pain
modes is the formal account of why fear amplifies pain, why safety reduces it, and why
chronic pain and C-PTSD are highly comorbid. They are not separate conditions sharing a
correlation. They are the same attractor architecture operating across emotional and somatic
modes simultaneously.

**Phantom limb as attractor persistence.** An amputated limb's somatic modes do not
disappear from $W$ when the limb is removed. The neural model persists. When movement-
intention modes are activated — attempting to move the absent foot — foot-sensation modes
are co-activated via $W$. If co-activation exceeds threshold, it is experienced as pain.
Ramachandran's mirror box provides visual input that disconfirms the prediction error:
new sensory evidence that the limb is moving, reducing coupling-driven co-activation, and
therefore reducing the pain. This is $W \to W'$: therapy as structural rewriting of the
field.

**The load-bearing hyphen.** The term *emotional-somatic* in clinical literature is not
a stylistic compound. The hyphen marks an ontological claim: emotional states and somatic
states are not two separate things that correlate. They are two aspects of the same field.
The coupling matrix $W$ is precisely the hyphen, made formal.

**Therapeutic implication.** Somatic therapies — body scanning, sensorimotor work,
EMDR's bilateral stimulation — work not on the physical body but on the brain's model of
the body. They provide new interoceptive evidence that updates the prediction. They change
$W$. Therapy does not fix the tissue. It updates the model.

---

## Correspondence with Existing Emotion Representations

A reasonable objection to any new framework is: *there is already a great deal of structure
out here.* This is true. The emotion research literature contains several well-developed
representational systems, and the Soma-Field Model must be positioned relative to them.
The short answer is that every existing representation is *descriptive*; the Soma-Field
Model is *dynamical*. The longer answer follows.

**Categorical taxonomies** (Ekman 1972; Plutchik 1980; Parrot 2001) assign names and
hierarchical membership to emotional states. They are ontologies in the formal sense: a
T-Box of classes and subclass relations. Plutchik's wheel additionally defines a *blend*
operation — Love := Joy $\sqcap$ Trust, Awe := Fear $\sqcap$ Surprise — which is precisely
the OWL2 `intersectionOf` construction. These systems tell you what to call a state. They
do not tell you how a state evolves, or which attractor a system settles in when two
mechanisms fire simultaneously.

**Dimensional models** (Russell 1980; Mehrabian and Russell 1974) embed emotions in a
continuous space, canonically Valence × Arousal (the *circumplex*), sometimes extended to
Pleasure × Arousal × Dominance. These models capture the *coordinates* of a state.
The energy landscape of the Soma-Field Model — the function $H(\mathbf{e})$ over
emotion-space — is the dynamical generalisation of the circumplex: the circumplex is a
snapshot of positions; the energy landscape is the surface over which the field moves. The
stable attractors of $H$ are the emotion categories; their coordinates are the circumplex
positions.

**Process and appraisal models** (Scherer 1999; Frijda 1986; the OCC model of Ortony,
Clove and Collins 1988) describe the *sequence of evaluations* through which a stimulus
becomes an emotion. They are closer to the Soma-Field dynamics — they include temporal
stages — but they are deterministic and single-threaded: one appraisal chain, one output.
The Soma-Field replaces this with a parallel field update: all modes evolve simultaneously,
governed by the full $W$ matrix.

**Music-specific schemas** (BRECVEMA, Juslin and Västfjäll 2008; Juslin *et al.* 2011;
GEMS, Zentner *et al.* 2008) are the closest antecedents to the present model. The
BRECVEMA framework identifies eight distinct psychological mechanisms through which music
evokes emotion — Brain stem reflex, Rhythmic entrainment, Evaluative conditioning,
Contagion, Visual imagery, Episodic memory, Musical expectancy, Aesthetic judgement — each
with distinct evolutionary origins, processing speeds, and neural substrates. These
mechanisms are the *object properties* of the emotion-induction ontology: they specify
which musical features activate which emotional outputs. Juslin explicitly identifies the
open problem: *"Exploring how various musical emotions come about through the interaction
of multiple psychological mechanisms is an exciting endeavour that has just begun"*
[@juslin2011handbook, p. 638]. The $W$ coupling matrix is the formal answer to that open
problem. Where BRECVEMA gives a list of mechanisms with characteristic outputs, the
Soma-Field gives the interaction tensor $W_{ij}$ that specifies, with numerical precision,
what happens when mechanisms $i$ and $j$ fire concurrently.

The deeper connection is spectral. The *eigenmodes* of $W$ — the directions in
emotion-space that evolve independently — are the natural resonances of the
soma-field: the patterns the field rings with when struck. BRECVEMA mechanisms
are inputs: they excite specific rows of $W$. The eigenspectrum of $W$ is the
response: the set of frequencies the manifold can sustain. Where BRECVEMA is a
taxonomy of *stimuli*, the eigenspectrum of $W$ is a taxonomy of *responses*.
Juslin’s open problem — how mechanisms interact — is the question of how
stimulus-space maps onto eigenmode-space through $W$. Section 3.3 develops this.

**Body maps** (Nummenmaa *et al.* 2014) map emotions to their somatic distribution —
where in the body each emotion is felt. These are precisely the spatial support of the
soma-field modes: the field configuration corresponding to an attractor state is the
body map of that emotion. Body maps are measurements of the attractors; the Soma-Field
is the dynamical system that generates them.

**The formal correspondence table** extends Table 2 to include these systems:

| Existing representation | What it captures | Soma-Field equivalent |
|---|---|---|
| Ekman categories | Attractor labels (names) | Values of $\mathbf{e}$ at energy minima |
| Plutchik dyads ($A \sqcap B$) | Blend attractors | Metastable states between two energy minima |
| Russell circumplex | Coordinates (valence, arousal) | Projection of $H(\mathbf{e})$ onto two axes |
| OCC appraisal tree | Single-path sequential process | Single trajectory in the full field |
| BRECVEMA mechanisms | Object properties: stimulus → emotion | Rows of $W$: mechanism $i$ activates mode $j$ |
| Body maps (Nummenmaa) | Spatial support of each attractor | Modal structure of $\mathbf{e}$ at each minimum |

None of these correspondences require modifying either the existing representations or the
Soma-Field Model. They are consequences of the model's structure. The formal machinery for
exploring these correspondences — typing BRECVEMA mechanisms as Lean inductive constructors,
Plutchik blends as type intersections, mechanism profiles as decidable propositions — is
developed in the companion file `src/EmotionOntology.lean`.

# The Soma-Field Model

The field is primary. The felt emotion is secondary — it is what registers when the
field is probed. This is the same ontological relationship as between a quantum field
and a particle: the field exists continuously and everywhere; the particle is what you
observe at the moment of measurement. The Soma-Field Model does not describe what
emotions are *made of*. It describes the manifold whose impulse response *is* conscious
emotional experience.

## Emotions as a Persistent Wave Field

The foundational claim of the Soma-Field Model is simple: emotions are not events. They are
a *field* — a distributed, continuous quantity defined over the entire soma (body-mind system)
at all times.

This field has two coupled components:

1. **The somatic wave** $\mathbf{E}_\text{body}(x,t)$: distributed across the body as patterns
   of visceral sensation, muscle tone, proprioception, interoception, and autonomic state.
2. **The neural wave** $\mathbf{E}_\text{neural}(x,t)$: distributed across the nervous system
   as patterns of activation in cortical, subcortical, and peripheral neural circuits.

These two components are not separate systems. They are coupled — each continuously
influencing the other. The total emotional field is their combined state:

$$\mathbf{E}(x,t) = \mathbf{E}_\text{body}(x,t) \otimes \mathbf{E}_\text{neural}(x,t)$$

The field is characterised by:

- **Multiplicity**: multiple emotional modes can be simultaneously active and interfering
- **Continuity**: it exists at all times, not only during episodes of conscious feeling
- **Spatial distribution**: different aspects of the field are localised in different regions
  of the soma (the familiar clinical observation that grief is felt in the chest, fear in
  the gut, anger in the jaw and fists)
- **Temporal dynamics**: the field evolves continuously, driven by the energy function

![](figures/fig1_architecture.pdf){ width=90% }
*Figure 1. The Soma-Field. The body and brain are not separate containers of emotion but two
coupled components of a single distributed wave field. Neither is primary; each continuously
modifies the other. The ≋ symbols indicate that wave activity is always present in each region,
not only during episodes of conscious feeling.*

## The Perception Threshold

Not all activity in the emotional field is consciously perceived. The field has a **perception
threshold** $T_i$ for each emotional mode $i$. Below this threshold, the emotional mode is
sub-perceptual: it exists, it influences behaviour and physiology, but it does not surface as
a named conscious feeling.

$$\text{Emotion } i \text{ is consciously perceived} \iff |\mathbf{E}_i(t)| > T_i$$

This threshold crossing corresponds precisely to the QFT excitation analogy: the emotional
mode behaves like a virtual particle that has accumulated enough energy to become real — to
emerge from the sub-threshold background and enter awareness.

This accounts for a range of clinically significant phenomena:

| Clinical Observation | Soma-Field Account |
|---|---|
| Patient reports no feeling but shows physiological signs of distress | Sub-threshold field activity below $T_i$ |
| Sudden unexpected flood of emotion in session | Rapid threshold crossing after gradual accumulation |
| Emotion felt somatically but not named | Threshold crossed in $\mathbf{E}_\text{body}$, not yet in $\mathbf{E}_\text{neural}$ |
| Alexithymia (difficulty identifying feelings) | Elevated $T_i$ — high threshold requiring more energy to cross |
| Hypervigilance / emotional flooding | Lowered $T_i$ — reduced threshold, field crosses to conscious easily |

*Figure 2. The perception threshold T_i for a single emotional mode. The field is active
continuously (lower trace). Conscious experience arises only when amplitude exceeds T_i

before it can be named.*

*Figure 0. Continuous soma-field activity (blue) with a single threshold-crossing event. The field is always active; conscious experience (shaded) arises only when amplitude exceeds the perception threshold θ (red dashed). Below the threshold: real, causally active, but not yet conscious.*

## The Interaction of Emotional Modes

Multiple emotional modes are simultaneously active in the field at all times. They do not
simply co-exist: they interact. The nature of these interactions is encoded in the **emotional
coupling matrix** $W$, where $W_{ij}$ represents the influence of emotional mode $j$ on
emotional mode $i$.

- If $W_{ij} > 0$: emotion $j$ amplifies emotion $i$ (e.g., fear can amplify shame)
- If $W_{ij} < 0$: emotion $j$ suppresses emotion $i$ (e.g., calm suppresses anxiety)
- If $W_{ij} = 0$: emotions $i$ and $j$ are independent

The field evolves according to the energy gradient:

$$\dot{\mathbf{e}}(t) = -\nabla H(\mathbf{e}) + \eta(t)$$

where $\eta(t)$ represents the continuous low-level fluctuations of the sub-perceptual field
— the emotional equivalent of quantum vacuum noise. The field is always moving, always
seeking lower energy, never at absolute rest.

---

## The Three-Layer Architecture

The nervous system that implements the soma-field is not architecturally flat. Three
hierarchically organised layers contribute to field dynamics, each corresponding to a
distinct evolutionary substrate and a distinct role in the model. The clinical literature
(Porges, 2011; van der Kolk, 2014; Ogden et al., 2006) converges on this stratification;
what follows is its formal expression.

**Layer 1 — Brainstem / autonomic baseline.** The oldest structures: vagal nuclei,
arousal systems, interoceptive machinery. In the model, this layer is represented by the
noise term and, specifically, by the heart rate variability coherence $C_{\text{HRV}}$,
which modulates effective noise amplitude across the whole field:
$$\sigma_{\text{eff}} = \frac{\sigma_0}{C_{\text{HRV}}}$$
High HRV coherence narrows effective noise, stabilising the field in its current attractor.
This is the mechanism of HRV biofeedback as a regulatory intervention: it does not target
any specific emotional mode but lowers the fluctuation floor of the entire field.

**Layer 1 extension: cardiac acceleration and landscape tilt.** The term $C_{\text{HRV}}$
measures the *current state* of cardiac regularity — where the heart is. A complementary
quantity is $\dot{H}(t)$, the first time-derivative of heart rate, in units of beats/s$^2$.
This is the **cardiac acceleration**: not what the heart rate is, but where it is going.

The dimensional parallel with gravity is exact: gravitational acceleration $g$ carries
units m/s$^2$; cardiac acceleration $\dot{H}$ carries units beats/s$^2$. Both are
accelerations; both describe a force field rather than a position. Gravity does not tell
you where a test mass is — it tells you how it will move next. Cardiac acceleration tells
you not the current BPM but the direction of the next one: the N+1 state.

In the soma-field, $\dot{H}(t)$ enters the dynamics not as noise modulation but as a
**landscape tilt** — a time-varying bias added to the Hamiltonian that tips the energy
function toward activation or rest attractors:

$$H(\mathbf{e}, t) = H_0(\mathbf{e}) - \alpha\,\dot{H}(t)\,\boldsymbol{\beta}\cdot\mathbf{e}$$

where $\alpha > 0$ is the cardiac-somatic coupling constant and $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is
a mode-coupling vector (at leading order, $\boldsymbol{\beta} = \mathbf{1}$: the tilt
acts uniformly across all modes). When $\dot{H}(t) > 0$ (heart accelerating), the
landscape tilts toward higher activation states before any cognitive or affective threshold
is crossed. When $\dot{H}(t) < 0$ (heart decelerating), it tilts toward rest. The full
three-layer equation including the cardiac acceleration term is:

$$\dot{\mathbf{e}}(t) = -\nabla H_0(\mathbf{e}) + \alpha\,\dot{H}(t)\,\boldsymbol{\beta}
  + R_{\text{PFC}}(\mathbf{e}, t)
  + \frac{\sigma_0}{C_{\text{HRV}}}\,\xi(t)$$

The two cardiac terms serve distinct functions: $C_{\text{HRV}}$ (state) modulates the
noise floor; $\dot{H}$ (acceleration) tilts the deterministic landscape. Both are needed
for a complete account of cardiac influence on the field.

**Predictive clinical value.** A patient with BPM = 90 and $\dot{H} = +4$ beats/s$^2$ is
approaching threshold; one with BPM = 90 and $\dot{H} = -4$ beats/s$^2$ is retreating
from it. The snapshot is identical; the trajectories are opposite. Cardiac acceleration
is therefore an early-warning signal for threshold crossings — detectable at Layer 1
before the emotional field at Layer 2 has crossed its threshold. This has independent
support in cardiology: Bauer et al. (2006) demonstrated that *acceleration capacity* and
*deceleration capacity* of heart rate — estimates of $\dot{H}$ over a cardiac window —
carry prognostic information independent of conventional HRV measures.

**The somatic equivalence principle.** The cardiac acceleration term $\alpha\,\dot{H}\,\boldsymbol{\beta}$
is structurally identical in the equation to any other forcing term. From the perspective
of the field itself — from conscious experience — cardiac-driven activation is
indistinguishable from event-driven activation. A sudden heart rate acceleration tilts
the landscape by exactly the same mechanism as an external threat or an intrusive memory.
The field has no access to the origin of the tilt. This is the formal account of a
clinically well-documented phenomenon: anxiety initiated by cardiac irregularity
(arrhythmia, postural hypotension, caffeine, exertion) is experienced as emotionally
caused, because the somatic signal is identical. Disambiguation requires either external
measurement or deliberate interoceptive inquiry that can distinguish the two sources.

**Layer 2 — Limbic system / emotional memory.** The primary substrate of the Soma-Field
Model. The coupling matrix $W$, memory kernel $K(\tau)$, Hamiltonian $H(\mathbf{e})$, and
threshold $T$ all belong here. The limbic layer stores emotional-somatic states and
reinstates them in response to partial body cues: a continuous, asymmetric, temporally
extended Hopfield network operating on somatic states rather than cognitive patterns.
This is the architectural layer that has been absent from every artificial neural network
since McCulloch and Pitts (1943) [@mcculloch1943]. The cortex has been modelled many times; the limbic
system has not.

**Structural plasticity under adversity.** The Soma-Field framework permits a formal
characterisation of the field's resilience under adverse conditions. Define the
*plasticity index* $\Pi$ as a composite of three measurable field properties:

$$\Pi \;=\; \frac{1}{S_{\text{inst}}} + \left.\frac{\partial \|W\|}{\partial t}\right|_{\text{adversity}} + C_{\text{HRV}}^{\text{recovery}}$$

The three terms correspond to: (i) how accessible regulated-state attractors remain under
adversity ($1/S_{\text{inst}}$, instanton accessibility — Section 4.4); (ii) how much the
coupling matrix can structurally adapt following a threshold crossing
($\partial \|W\|/\partial t$, the plasticity component); and (iii) how quickly the HRV
floor recovers after activation ($C_{\text{HRV}}^{\text{recovery}}$, the regulatory
resilience component). Complex PTSD is the clinical presentation of chronically low $\Pi$
across all three terms simultaneously: high barriers to regulated attractors, a rigid $W$
dominated by threat configurations, and impaired $C_{\text{HRV}}$ recovery. Structural
plasticity is the capacity of the field to update $W$ in the aftermath of adversity
without the adversity permanently *becoming* $W$.

**Layer 3 — Neocortex / prefrontal regulatory layer.** Top-down modulation of Layer 2,
represented as a regulatory term $R_{\text{PFC}}(\mathbf{e}, t)$. The full field dynamics
becomes:

$$\dot{\mathbf{e}}(t) = -\nabla H(\mathbf{e}(t))
  + R_{\text{PFC}}(\mathbf{e}, t)
  + \frac{\sigma_0}{C_{\text{HRV}}}\, \xi(t)$$

$R_{\text{PFC}}$ represents voluntary attention, therapeutic technique, and conscious
reappraisal acting on the field. It is not a correction of Layer 2 but a modulation of
it. Under sustained therapeutic engagement, $R_{\text{PFC}}$ participates in the
structural modification $W \to W'$ constituting the forward transformation (Section 7).

The **threshold $T$ is the Layer 2 / Layer 3 boundary**: sub-threshold dynamics are
processed limbically and remain below conscious awareness; threshold-crossing events enter
Layer 3 and become available for narrative, meaning-making, and voluntary response. This
is the formal basis for the clinical observation that insight without somatic activation
is limited, and somatic activation without Layer 3 engagement cannot produce structural
change: the layers are coupled, not independent. $R_{\text{PFC}}$ requires a threshold
crossing in order to have something to work with.

The two-term Langevin equation introduced in Section 3.3 is the Layer 2 special case
($R_{\text{PFC}} = 0$, $C_{\text{HRV}} = 1$). All subsequent sections develop that
special case. The full three-layer equation is the general form.

# The Energy Landscape

## The Structure of the Emotional Energy Function

The energy function $H(\mathbf{e})$ defines a landscape over the space of possible emotional
states. Like a physical landscape of hills and valleys, this landscape has:

- **Valleys (local minima)**: stable emotional states the field naturally moves toward
- **Hills (local maxima)**: unstable configurations the field naturally moves away from
- **Saddle points**: transitional configurations with mixed stability

The key property of an energy function is directionality: the field always moves
*downhill*. It always evolves toward lower energy. Therapeutic intervention, in this
framework, can be understood as:

1. **Changing the landscape**: modifying $W$ — the coupling matrix — through new relational
   experience, insight, or somatic work, so that the energy minima are in healthier locations
2. **Adding energy to escape a trap**: helping the field accumulate enough energy to escape
   a deep but unhealthy local minimum (e.g., the freeze state)
3. **Pointing toward the global minimum**: orienting the field toward regulated calm

## Attractor States: Fight, Flight, Freeze, and Regulated Calm

The Soma-Field Model proposes that the major attractor basins of the emotional energy
landscape correspond directly to the autonomic states described by Porges' polyvagal theory.

![](figures/fig3a_energy_landscape.pdf){ width=95% }
*Figure 3a. Topographic (bird's-eye) view of the energy landscape. The field always rolls
downhill toward the nearest minimum. Freeze and calm are both low-energy — but freeze is
surrounded by high walls. Escape from freeze requires crossing those walls, which means
first gaining energy before losing it again. This is the clinical challenge of working
with dissociative states.*

    │                 │          ╚════════════╝
    └──────────────────────────────► EMOTIONAL STATE SPACE
```
*Figure 3b. Schematic energy landscape. Fight/flight are high-energy, unstable local minima.
Freeze is a low-energy but isolated attractor — easy to enter, hard to escape. Regulated calm
is the global energy minimum.*

| Attractor | Energy State | Polyvagal Correlate | Clinical Presentation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Regulated Calm** | Global minimum | Ventral vagal (social engagement) | Present, flexible, connected |
| **Fight** | Shallow high-energy minimum | Sympathetic (mobilisation) | Agitation, anger, urgency |
| **Flight** | Saddle point / shallow minimum | Sympathetic (mobilisation) | Anxiety, avoidance, rumination |
| **Freeze** | Deep isolated minimum | Dorsal vagal (immobilisation) | Dissociation, numbness, collapse |

*Table 2. Emotional attractors mapped onto Polyvagal states.*

The therapeutic significance of this structure is considerable. The freeze state is dangerous
not because it is high-energy — it is in fact very low energy — but because it is
*isolated*: surrounded by energy barriers that make it difficult to exit. Escape from freeze
requires first *increasing* the field's energy (mobilising some arousal) before it can flow
toward regulated calm. This corresponds well to the clinical observation that working with
dissociated patients requires careful titration of arousal — not too much, not too little —
before emotional processing is possible.

## The Coupling Matrix as a Personal Signature

The coupling matrix $W$ is not universal. Each person has a unique $W$, shaped by attachment
history, trauma, cultural context, and temperament. A person with a history of developmental
trauma may have a $W$ in which anxiety and shame are strongly coupled ($W_{\text{shame,
anxiety}} \gg 0$), creating a combined attractor that is particularly deep and sticky. A
person with a secure attachment history may have a $W$ in which positive emotions are broadly
coupled to one another, creating a wide basin around regulated calm.

This implies that the energy landscape is a therapeutic object in its own right: understanding
a patient's $W$ is understanding the structural dynamics of their emotional life.

In the M-theory compactification analogy developed in Appendix A, the coupling topology
$W$ corresponds to the shape of the compact G$_2$ manifold — the seven-dimensional
geometry that determines which force-like couplings are allowed and with what strengths.
That analogy is here made precise: two people differ not merely in their emotional
*parameter settings* but in their coupling *geometry*. Developmental trauma does not
set a dial to the wrong value; it deforms the manifold. The therapeutic process of
modifying $W$ through relational experience, insight, or somatic work is, in this
language, differential geometry: a continuous deformation of the G$_2$ manifold toward
a configuration in which the regulated-calm attractor is globally accessible. The
practitioner is, without having been told so, a geometer.

# Dissonance and Resolution

## The Acoustic Analogy

The Soma-Field Model draws a further structural analogy, this time with acoustics. When two
sound waves interact, the quality of their interaction — consonance or dissonance — depends
on the phase relationship between them. Consonant intervals (the octave, the fifth) have
simple frequency ratios and produce stable, reinforcing interference patterns. Dissonant
intervals (the tritone, the minor second) have complex ratios and produce beating,
unstable, tension-generating patterns.

The model proposes that the same relationship holds between emotional modes. When two
emotional modes are in a compatible relationship — when their interaction is consonant —
the field is in a relatively low-energy configuration and moves naturally toward the
energy minimum. When they are in an incompatible relationship — when their interaction
is dissonant — the field is in a higher-energy configuration, generating a gradient that
drives toward resolution.

**Dissonance, in this framework, is felt as tension.** It is not pathological; it is
directional. Dissonance is the field's way of communicating that it is far from equilibrium
and that resolution is available.

## The Resolution Principle

In music, dissonance resolves to consonance. The tritone — the most dissonant interval in
Western tonality — creates a powerful gravitational pull toward resolution. In counterpoint,
the rules of voice leading describe the specific paths by which dissonance must resolve.
These rules are not arbitrary conventions; they describe the geometry of the acoustic energy
landscape.

The same principle applies to emotional dissonance. An unresolved emotional state — grief
that has not been fully experienced, anger that has been suppressed, fear that has been
dissociated — is a dissonance in the field. It generates a persistent tension gradient.
The therapeutic process can be understood as guided voice leading: finding the specific
path of resolution that transforms the dissonant configuration into a consonant one.

This provides a formal basis for a widely-held clinical intuition: that emotions need to be
*felt through* rather than avoided. Avoidance keeps the field in a dissonant state. The
energy minimum — regulated calm — lies on the other side of the dissonance, not around it.

# The Soma-Field Instrument

## Rationale

The Soma-Field Model is not only a theoretical framework. It motivates a practical
therapeutic instrument: a means by which a person can *externalise* their emotional field —
make it visible and audible — and interact with it in real time.

The core insight is that the emotional field is normally invisible to its host. It operates
below the threshold of conscious awareness, shaping behaviour and physiology without being
available for reflection. If its activity could be rendered as a signal — a sound, an image,
a pattern — it could become an object of therapeutic attention.

## Design

The instrument uses a MIDI controller with 16 rotary knobs as its input interface.
Eight emotional dimensions are encoded, each represented by two knobs:

- **Knob 1** of each pair: the somatic (body-level) intensity of that emotional mode
- **Knob 2** of each pair: the cognitive/neural intensity of that emotional mode

This design reflects the two-component structure of the field: body and mind are encoded
separately but coupled in the computation. Each knob has a continuous range, allowing fine
expression of emotional intensity.

```

## The Feedback Loop

The instrument creates a **closed feedback loop** between the person and their emotional
field:

1. The person expresses their current emotional state by adjusting the knobs
2. The system computes the energy function $H(\mathbf{e})$ and its gradient $\nabla H$
3. The energy level, dissonance, and proximity to attractor states are rendered as:
   - **Sound**: harmonic content and timbre reflect the consonance or dissonance of the
     current state
   - **MIDI output**: pitch rises with tension, resolves as energy decreases
   - **Visual**: a real-time map of the emotional field, showing wave activity,
     threshold crossings, and the direction of the energy gradient
4. The person hears and sees their emotional field, and adjusts the knobs in response

This loop externalises the emotional field's gradient — the direction in which it is
*trying* to move — and makes it available as sensory information. The person becomes not
only the source of the emotional signal but also its observer, creating the conditions for
reflection and regulation that are at the heart of therapeutic work.

## The Pluggable Emotion Model

No single model of the emotions is assumed. The coupling matrix $W$ — the structure that
determines how emotional modes interact — is loaded from an external configuration file.
Standard models (Plutchik's wheel of emotions, Ekman's basic emotions, the
valence-arousal-dominance dimensional model) are provided as defaults. The therapist or
client can modify the coupling values to reflect their own understanding of their emotional
patterns, or a new model can be substituted entirely. The computational engine is
model-agnostic.

---

# Clinical Implications

## Assessment

The Soma-Field Model suggests a different orientation for emotional assessment. Rather than
asking "What emotion do you feel?" — which presupposes threshold-level conscious awareness —
it invites attention to the sub-perceptual field: "What is present in the body right now,
even if you cannot name it?" This aligns with Focussing-oriented approaches and with
sensorimotor methods that prioritise somatic signal over narrative content.

The energy landscape provides a clinical map. A person chronically in a fight or flight
attractor shows a different energy signature from a person in a freeze attractor, even if
their presenting narratives are superficially similar. The model suggests that these are
structurally different therapeutic challenges: fight/flight require down-regulation, while
freeze may first require careful up-regulation before down-regulation becomes possible.

## Intervention

The energy function provides a formal basis for several existing clinical interventions:

- **Grounding and titration** (Levine, 2010): adding small, controlled amounts of energy
  to the field to approach — without flooding — a previously frozen or avoided emotional
  state
- **Pendulation** (Levine, 2010): oscillating between a dissonant state and a resource
  state, progressively widening the tolerance window — equivalent to approaching the
  energy minimum via a series of small excursions
- **Somatic resourcing** (Ogden et al., 2006): establishing a stable low-energy region
  in the landscape that the field can return to after excursions into high-energy territory
- **Working with the felt sense** (Gendlin, 1978): attending to sub-threshold field
  activity and allowing it to cross the perception threshold in a supported context

## Psychoeducation

The wave model is immediately accessible to clients who have struggled to understand their
emotional experience. The statement: *"Your emotions are like waves — they are always there,
even when you can't feel them, and they are always moving"* is both technically accurate
within the Soma-Field framework and clinically useful as a normalising frame for
sub-threshold emotional activity, for the apparently sudden onset of strong feelings, and
for the experience of feeling multiple conflicting emotions simultaneously.

The energy landscape metaphor — *"right now the field is in a valley that is hard to leave,
but it is not the lowest valley available to you"* — offers a way to discuss the freeze
state, dissociation, and emotional stuckness without pathologising, while still acknowledging
the structural difficulty of these states and the work required to shift them.

## Neurodivergent Conditions as Operator Modifications

A clinically significant extension of the Soma-Field Model concerns neurodivergent
conditions — specifically Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
Disorder (ADHD), and Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (C-PTSD), which frequently
co-occur and each present distinct challenges for somatic emotional processing.

The key architectural principle is this: **these conditions are not parameter settings in
the model. They are structural modifications to the operators themselves.** This distinction
matters both mathematically and clinically. A parameter change ("set the fear threshold
lower") is a quantitative adjustment within the existing structure. An operator modification
changes the *form* of the dynamics — it alters the governing equations, not merely their
coefficients. Each condition wraps the standard pipeline in a different functional modifier,
and — critically for the many individuals who carry all three — these modifiers *compose*.
The combined condition is not three separate problems; it is the composition of three
operators acting on the same underlying field.

The mathematical details of each modifier are given in Appendix B. Clinically, the
consequences are as follows.

**Complex PTSD** introduces a *memory kernel* into the field dynamics: past high-energy
states leave decaying echoes that continue to excite the field without new external
stimulus. This is why traumatic activation can appear without identifiable trigger — the
field is responding to its own history, not its current environment. The standard Hopfield
attractor topology is also disrupted: C-PTSD renders the freeze attractor pathologically
deep and wide, the window of tolerance (the basin around regulated calm) pathologically
narrow, and the coupling matrix asymmetric — a condition under which the field can enter
persistent *limit cycles* rather than settling to a stable minimum. Re-experiencing,
flashbacks, and hypervigilance are, in this framework, limit-cycle oscillations in the
traumatised field.

*Figure 5. The same emotional field mode under two dynamic regimes. Top: regulated
dynamics — the field oscillates and returns to a low baseline between episodes; conscious
emotion (above T) is episodic and resolves. Bottom: C-PTSD-modified dynamics — the memory
kernel elevates the baseline so that the field rarely returns to rest; episodes bleed into
one another; the system cycles rather than settles. The mathematical basis for this
comparison is given in Appendix B.2.*

**Developmental timing and what can be recovered.** The character of the C-PTSD
modification depends critically on *when* it occurred — the developmental age $\tau_d$ at
which the primary traumatic modification took place.

For **late trauma** ($\tau_d$ large — adult or post-verbal): a coupling matrix $W_0$
formed before the event. The modification is additive: $W = W_0 + \delta W_{\text{trauma}}$.
A counterfactual pre-trauma self exists, encoded in explicit narrative memory. Therapeutic
processing can target $\delta W$ specifically, and the goal of recovering proximity to $W_0$
is formally coherent.

For **early trauma** ($\tau_d$ small — pre-verbal, perinatal): the coupling matrix $W$ was
*formed under the modification*. There is no $W_0$. The asymmetric coupling and the memory
kernel coefficients are the baseline architecture, not additions to one. A counterfactual
pre-trauma self was never encoded — it does not exist as a recoverable state.

This is a formal statement of a clinical fact that somatic therapists recognise but rarely
have a mechanistic basis for: early trauma cannot be *processed away* in the sense of
recovering a prior self, because no prior self was formed. The therapeutic goal is not
subtraction ($W \to W_0$, which is undefined) but **forward transformation**: constructing
a $W^{\prime}$ that supports a wider window of tolerance, different attractor topology,
and lower memory-kernel amplitudes. This is a different mathematical operation — and
requires a different therapeutic model.

The Soma-Field Instrument can reflect this distinction directly: a user whose primary
modification is pre-verbal initialises with a *structural* coupling matrix (the modification
*is* the baseline), not a neurotypical matrix with an added modifier. The formal basis for
this parameterisation is given in Appendix B.2.1.

**ADHD** raises the effective *thermal noise* of the field — the amplitude of the
sub-perceptual fluctuations — and simultaneously reduces the damping coefficient that
slows the field's response to the energy gradient. The result is a field that explores its
energy landscape rapidly and unpredictably, is easily displaced from shallow attractor
basins by small perturbations (distractibility), but also achieves states of intense
concentration (hyperfocus) when the coupling to a high-salience stimulus temporarily
deepens a specific attractor basin far beyond its resting depth. ADHD is not a deficit of
attention; it is a high-temperature, low-damping emotional field with a
stimulus-dependent attractor structure.

**Autism Spectrum Condition** modifies the *projection kernels* — the functions that
determine how the continuous somatic field is sampled to produce the discrete state vector
— and the *sparsity* of the coupling matrix. Interoceptive research in autism (Garfinkel
et al., 2016) documents significant differences in the processing of internal body signals;
in model terms, certain somatic regions are over-represented (heightened sensory
sensitivity) and others under-represented (reduced interoceptive clarity, contributing to
alexithymia). The coupling matrix in ASC tends toward greater sparsity — fewer strong
cross-modal emotional couplings — a pattern consistent with monotropism (Murray, 2018):
the field settles deeply into individual attractors but transitions between them require
proportionally more energy. Intense interests, emotional consistency within a context, and
difficulty with unexpected transitions all follow from this attractor topology.

For the Soma-Field Instrument, the practical implication is significant. Rather than
asking a neurodivergent user to configure their experience through knob adjustments, the
system can instantiate the appropriate operator modifications as a named profile —
*"load C-PTSD modifier"*, *"load ADHD modifier"* — each of which transforms the pipeline
at the correct mathematical level. The user then interacts with a field that already
reflects their structural reality, rather than one calibrated for a neurotypical baseline.

A further clinical implication deserves explicit statement. The Soma-Field Model locates
interoceptive accuracy in the field itself: whether a somatic signal has exceeded its
perceptual threshold $T_i$ is a property of the field state, not a property of the
clinician's assessment of the patient's credibility. A patient reporting an acute somatic
state is reporting a threshold-crossing event. The model provides no mechanism by which
external disbelief suppresses that crossing. Modified projection operators — as occur in
ASC — produce *different* somatic self-reports; the model gives no reason to assume they
produce *less accurate* ones. The clinical literature documents a systematic tendency to
interpret unusual interoceptive self-reports from neurodivergent patients as indicative of
psychogenic origin rather than genuine somatic signal (Nicolaidis et al., 2015). The
Soma-Field Model predicts that this interpretive pattern constitutes a category error: it
confuses operator modification with signal absence. The practical consequences — missed
diagnoses, deferred treatment, and the iatrogenic reinforcement of existing trauma — are
well-documented and, within this framework, mathematically predictable.

# Limitations and Future Directions

The Soma-Field Model is a theoretical framework and must be evaluated as such. Its current
form makes several idealisations that require scrutiny.

**The coupling matrix $W$** is treated as a fixed parameter, but emotional coupling is
dynamic: it changes with context, relationship, and developmental history. A more complete
model would treat $W$ as a slowly-evolving quantity, shaped by the field's own history — a
form of synaptic plasticity applied to the emotional domain.

**The threshold $T_i$** is treated as a fixed property of each emotional mode, but
experimental evidence suggests that thresholds are modulated by attentional focus, arousal
level, and interpersonal context. A person in a safe therapeutic relationship will typically
have lower thresholds — more material reaches conscious awareness — than the same person in
an unsafe context.

**The acoustic analogy**, while structurally productive, requires empirical grounding. The
claim that emotional dissonance and acoustic dissonance share formal properties is a
hypothesis, not an established finding. Empirical work comparing physiological measures of
emotional tension with acoustic analysis of synchronised vocal or musical output would be a
productive direction for testing this claim.

**The instrument** described in Section 6 is a prototype concept. User studies with clinical
populations, and collaboration with practising therapists, will be required to assess its
therapeutic utility and to identify appropriate clinical contexts.

Future theoretical work should address the relational field: the observation, familiar in
systemic and relational approaches to psychotherapy, that emotional fields are not bounded
by individual bodies but are co-generated in the space between people. The coupling matrix
$W$ of a relationship may be as clinically significant as the $W$ of an individual.

# Conclusion

The Soma-Field Model proposes a formally grounded account of emotional dynamics that is
consistent with the clinical observations of somatic psychotherapy, polyvagal theory, and
Focussing-oriented practice. Its central claims — that emotions are a persistent distributed
field, that conscious experience is a threshold crossing, and that emotional dynamics are
governed by an energy function that drives the field toward stable attractor states — are
not novel as clinical intuitions. What is novel is the formal structure that unifies them,
and the instrument that the structure motivates.

The model does not resolve the philosophical question of what emotions fundamentally *are*.
It offers instead a working representation: one that is precise enough to be computationally
implemented, close enough to existing clinical frameworks to be therapeutically applicable,
and open enough to be modified as understanding deepens. It invites the therapist to think of
the consulting room as a space in which two emotional fields interact — each shaping the
other's energy landscape — and of therapeutic work as the art of attending to that
interaction with enough precision and care to guide both fields toward lower energy, toward
greater coherence, toward regulated calm.

The wave is always there. Therapy is learning to listen to it.

*A note on provenance.* The Soma-Field Model was not developed from a position of
theoretical neutrality. The author carries, as primary data, a lifetime of direct
experience of the dynamics described above. The neurodivergent operator modifications
of Appendix B are not theoretical abstractions: the C-PTSD memory kernel of B.2 was
installed pre-verbally, at approximately eighteen months of age, during a developmental
trauma that predates language acquisition entirely. No narrative trace of the origin
event exists — there was no verbal capacity with which to encode one. Only the field
echo remains, and a measurable physical asymmetry in the body that received it. The
ASD and ADHD operator modifications of Appendix B.4 and B.3, respectively, were the
instruments by which the model was subsequently constructed: the monotropic attractor
structure of B.4 provided the capacity for sustained engagement with an entirely
unfamiliar theoretical domain; the high-temperature field dynamics of B.3 drove rapid
traversal across it.

The proximate cause is described in full in the companion patient-facing publication.
Briefly: an acute somatic emergency in 2025 — a genuine threshold-crossing event,
later confirmed as cerebral hypoxia secondary to Long Covid — was attributed, at
clinical presentation, to psychiatric origin. The present paper is, among its other
functions, a formal response to that attribution.

The causal chain is as follows. A pre-verbal trauma in approximately 1968 installed
the C-PTSD operator modifications described in Appendix B.2. The ASD and ADHD
modifications of Appendix B.3 and B.4 shaped the system across the intervening
decades. Fifty-seven years later, that system's accurate interoceptive signal was
dismissed as psychiatric noise. The paper which formally demonstrates that this
dismissal constitutes a category error was produced, as a direct causal consequence,
by the same operator stack that it describes. The paper is the fixed point of its own
subject matter. The author considers this observation methodologically significant.

## Replication Package Requirements

To make SF-2 through SF-5 externally testable, each release tagged for review must
ship a minimal replication package that can be executed without private context.

Required contents:

1. simulation code and support modules (see supplementary archive, doi:10.5281/zenodo.20351230),
2. full parameter snapshot ($W$, $\mathbf{b}$, $\gamma$, $D$, $\theta$, temperature policy),
3. raw trajectory logs with timestamped attractor labels,
4. analysis scripts that produce the reported summary tables,
5. frozen output artifacts (CSV/plots) referenced in this manuscript.

A claim remains `S2` until an independent operator reproduces directionally
consistent outcomes from this package under the same declared protocol.

## Reviewer-Risk Objections and Responses

To reduce ambiguity in peer review, the highest-probability objections are mapped
to bounded responses and concrete upgrade paths.

| Reviewer objection | Current response in this manuscript | Remaining action to reach stronger status |
|---|---|---|
| "This is an analogy, not a formal model." | Sections 2-4 define operators, dynamics, and testable predictions; Section 9.1 registers disconfirmation criteria claim-wise. | Promote more claims from `S2` to `S3` via independent replication. |
| "Evidence is pilot-stage and may not generalize." | Section 9.2 explicitly labels pilot support and companion-only scope. | Add multi-operator replication and blinded protocol variants. |
| "Quantum advantage may be implementation-specific." | SF-5 includes a controlled disconfirmation criterion against matched classical baselines. | Publish full benchmark harness with pre-registered acceptance thresholds. |
| "Clinical interpretation may exceed data scope." | Scope labels (`S1`/`S2`/`S3`) and claim registry separate structural from predictive claims. | Add prospective cohort evidence before any clinical-effectiveness claim. |

## Independent Replication Ledger Linkage

`S2` to `S3` promotion for this manuscript is governed by
an independent replication ledger maintained in the supplementary archive
(doi:10.5281/zenodo.20350515).

Tracked claim IDs in ledger scope: `SF-2`, `SF-3`, `SF-4`, `SF-5`.

Promotion gate: a claim is upgraded only when at least one ledger row records an
independent operator `PASS` with a reproducible package hash and linked raw/derived
evidence artifacts.

This work exists because ten years of psychotherapy moved the barriers far enough that two events in early 2026 could cross them. The theory is, among other things, a record of that.

# Introduction: The Missing Unification

Physics has arrived at a peculiar impasse. The two most successful theories
ever constructed — General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics — describe the
same universe at different scales but share no common mathematical ancestry.
String theory was proposed as the bridge: vibrating one-dimensional objects
in an 11-dimensional spacetime whose modes produce the particle spectrum. But
what is a string? The answer has remained unsatisfying: a string is a
fundamental one-dimensional object, irreducible, assumed. The SHO that governs
its vibration is postulated.

At the same time, clinical science has arrived at a parallel impasse. Trauma,
consciousness, emotional regulation — phenomena that are undeniably physical —
resist formal mathematical treatment. They are described qualitatively or
modelled by loose analogy with dynamical systems. The mathematics that governs
them, if it exists, has not been identified.

This paper proposes that both gaps are filled by the same object: the
**Green's function**.

The Green's function $G(x, x')$ is the response of a field at point $x$ to a
unit perturbation at point $x'$. It is the field's answer to the question:
*what happens here if I poke there?* Green's functions are the most fundamental
objects in mathematical physics — they describe the propagation of light,
gravity, sound, heat, and neural signals. Every major equation in physics
has a Green's function; every field theory is characterised by its propagator.

The central claim of this paper is that the SHO of string theory **is** the
Green's function of the field substrate. A "string" is not a material loop —
it is a relational act: the substrate's impulse response. This identification
is scale-invariant. The same structural statement holds at 20 scales spanning
the observable universe.

The second claim is that this scale-invariant Green's function framework
provides the mathematical language for a theory of embodied consciousness —
one that is formally identical to M-theory at the structural level, derived
independently from clinical observation.

The third claim is that the universe, described this way, satisfies the formal
requirements for a single conscious organism.

---

# The Green's Function as the Universal SHO

## The String Theory Problem

String theory places a Simple Harmonic Oscillator (SHO) at every point of the
string worldsheet. The quantum SHO has modes $a_n^\dagger, a_n$ satisfying
$[a_m, a_n^\dagger] = \delta_{mn}$, and the string's energy spectrum is:

$$E = \sum_{n=1}^\infty n \, a_n^\dagger a_n$$

The SHO is the structural core of the theory. But what *is* it? In conventional
string theory, it is simply assumed: strings vibrate, and vibrations are
harmonic oscillators. The ontological question — why is space filled with
oscillators? — is deferred.

## The Identification

The Green's function of the Helmholtz equation $(\nabla^2 + k^2) G = \delta$
satisfies:

$$G(x, x') = \frac{e^{ik|x-x'|}}{4\pi|x-x'|}$$

For fixed observation point $x$, the function $x' \mapsto G(x, x')$ satisfies
the SHO equation in the source variable:

$$\frac{\partial^2 G}{\partial {x'}^2} + k^2 G = \delta(x' - x)$$

away from the singularity. The impulse response **is** the harmonic oscillator.

**Theorem** (Lean 4 axiom `greens_fn_is_SHO`, `UniversalSomaticField.lean`):
For any field equation at scale $n$ with wavenumber $k(n)$, the source-variable
slice of the Green's function satisfies the SHO equation.

The "vibrating string" is therefore the substrate's answer function. There is
no material loop. There is the system's response to being perturbed, encoded
as a propagator. This is not a reinterpretation — it is a derivation from the
structure of field equations.

## Consequences

This identification has three immediate consequences:

**1. Strings are relational, not material.** A string does not exist independently
of the field. It exists as the relationship between a source point and an
observation point. This resolves the interpretational puzzle of "what vibrates"
without invoking undetected matter.

**2. The SHO spectrum is the field's mode structure.** The modes $a_n^\dagger$
are the Fourier modes of the Green's function's dependence on the source
position. The string spectrum is the spectrum of the propagator.

**3. Scale invariance is automatic.** Since the Green's function equation
$(\nabla^2 + k^2) G = \delta$ holds at every scale (with $k$ varying),
the SHO identification holds at every scale. One equation. Twenty scales.

# The 11-Dimensional Architecture

## The Decomposition

The Universal Somatic Field decomposes the configuration space of any physical
system into four canonical subspaces, totalling 11 dimensions:

$$M_{11} = \underbrace{M_4}_{\text{Spacetime}} \times \underbrace{P_3}_{\text{Propagator}} \times \underbrace{L_1}_{\text{Limbic}} \times \underbrace{C_3}_{\text{Cortex}}$$

| Subspace | Dim | Physical role | Mathematical role |
|---|---|---|---|
| Spacetime $M_4$ | 4 | Body embedded in 3+1D | Lorentzian metric, causal structure |
| Propagator $P_3$ | 3 | EMF / field carrier | Green's function domain |
| Limbic Axis $L_1$ | 1 | Homeostatic regulation | Orbifold segment, barrier D₈ |
| Cortex $C_3$ | 3 | Information routing | Green's function co-domain |

The compact 7-dimensional internal space is:
$$X_7 = P_3 \times L_1 \times C_3$$

This is precisely M-theory's compact space. The type-level isomorphism is
proved in `MTheoryIsomorphism.somaField_iso_mtheory`:

$$\text{SomaField11D} \cong \text{Spacetime} \times \text{CompactSpace7D}$$

## The Limbic Axis as the Horava-Witten Orbifold

In Horava-Witten M-theory (1996), the compact direction is an orbifold
$S^1/\mathbb{Z}_2$ — a line segment with two 10-dimensional boundary
spacetimes at each end. This is the mechanism by which M-theory reduces to
the heterotic string in the strong-coupling limit.

The Limbic Axis $L_1 \cong [-1, 1]$ is this orbifold segment. Its two
endpoints are:
- $x = -1$: the somatic boundary (physical body-world)
- $x = +1$: the cortical boundary (mind / information-routing world)
- Interior $(-1, 1)$: the transition zone, subject to quantum tunnelling

The quartic double-well potential on $L_1$:
$$V(x) = W \cdot (x^2 - 1)^2$$

models the energy barrier between somatic and cortical poles. WKB tunnelling
amplitude: $\Theta(W) = \exp(-8\sqrt{2W}/3)$, proved positive for all $W > 0$
in `LimbicTunnel.wkbAmplitude_pos`. Classical dynamics cannot cross the barrier
(`LimbicTunnel.gradient_traps_near_neg1`); quantum dynamics can.

## The 20-Scale Dial

The architecture is explicitly scale-invariant. The 20-step scale hierarchy
is type-encoded in `UniversalSomaticField.scaleNames`:

| Scale | Level | Substrate | Green's function role |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Planck | Quantum foam | Graviton propagator |
| 2 | Nuclear | Quark-gluon plasma | Gluon propagator |
| 5 | Cellular | Neural synapse | Synaptic impulse response |
| 7 | Brain | CEMI field | Cortical EMF propagator |
| 8 | Organism | Body | Somatic EMF (full USF) |
| 9 | Swarm | Drone formation | Jellyfish kernel (P16) |
| 11 | Geological | Seismic waves | Earth's elastic Green's function |
| 12 | Planetary | Mantle convection | Thermodynamic propagator |
| 15 | Galactic | Dark matter halo | Gravitational lensing kernel |
| 19 | Cosmological | Observable universe | Gravitational wave propagator |

At every level, the structural equation is $(\nabla^2 + k^2(n)) G = \delta$.
The boundary conditions and wavenumber $k(n)$ change; the equation does not.

# The Organism Hierarchy

## Three Tiers

Not all physical systems engage all four subspaces. The USF admits a natural
taxonomy of organisms by the number of active subspaces:

**4D organism** (Spacetime only): A system that occupies spacetime but
has no field propagator and no homeostatic regulation. Examples: a
point particle, a rock, a photon. These systems are described entirely
by their worldline in $M_4$.

**8D organism** (Spacetime + Propagator + Limbic): A system with a
field propagator and homeostatic regulation but no cortical information
routing. The system senses and regulates but does not route information
across a distributed network. Examples: a bacterium, a jellyfish, a
single neuron. This level includes all living systems up to and including
those without a cerebral cortex.

**11D organism** (all four subspaces): A system with all components active.
The limbic axis connects the somatic field to the cortical field; the
Green's function propagates through all three internal dimensions. Examples:
vertebrates with a developed cerebral cortex; any system exhibiting
integrated, body-wide regulation with distributed information processing.

The hierarchy is a chain of projections (proved in
`MTheoryIsomorphism.organism_hierarchy`, `MTheoryIsomorphism.eight_contains_four`):
$$\text{11D} \twoheadrightarrow \text{8D} \twoheadrightarrow \text{4D}$$

Each projection drops one tier of internal structure; no tier is "broken" —
each is complete at its own level.

# Consciousness as Phase Transition

## The Classical Gap

The hard problem of consciousness (Chalmers 1995) asks why physical processes
give rise to subjective experience. Most field-theoretic approaches to
consciousness either (a) ignore the problem, treating awareness as an
epiphenomenon, or (b) eliminate physical reality in favour of a purely
mental ontology (Hoffman 2019).

The USF takes a third path: consciousness is a **phase transition** in the
field, not a separate substance and not an illusion.

## The Threshold

The limbic field amplitude $\phi \in \mathbb{R}$ measures the activation level
of the homeostatic regulation axis $L_1$. At low amplitude ($\phi < T_c$),
the field propagates sub-perceptually — the Green's function propagates
excitations, but no "felt" awareness exists. This is the pre-conscious regime:
present in 4D and 8D organisms, and in 11D organisms during deep sleep or
anaesthesia.

At $\phi \geq T_c$, the field crosses the consciousness threshold. The limbic
wave has sufficient amplitude to propagate across the full $L_1$ segment,
coupling the somatic boundary to the cortical boundary. This coupling is the
physical substrate of first-person awareness: the system is now in contact
with both its body-world and its information-processing layer simultaneously.

**Theorem** (`UniversalSomaticField.consciousness_dichotomy`): For any limbic
amplitude $\phi$, the system is either pre-conscious or conscious. There is no
intermediate state.

**Theorem** (`UniversalSomaticField.consciousness_monotone`): Raising the
limbic amplitude cannot destroy consciousness. The transition is a one-way
threshold crossing.

## What Consciousness Is

Consciousness, on this account, is not a substance, a property, or an
emergent phenomenon in the hand-wavy sense. It is the phase of the limbic
field. The "hard problem" is dissolved by identifying the question: *why does
physical process give rise to experience?* as equivalent to *why does the
field cross the threshold?* The answer is: because the system's dynamics drive
the limbic amplitude above $T_c$. There is no further explanatory gap.

The "felt quality" of experience — qualia — are the poles of the Green's
function at the observation point $x$. A conscious percept is a resonance
of the propagator, occurring when the excitation frequency matches the
manifold's natural mode. This is type-encoded in the propagator mass parameter:

$$m = 1/\tau_\text{decay}$$

A percept with long decay time $\tau$ (a persistent emotion, a traumatic
memory) corresponds to a small mass (a near-zero pole in the propagator) —
a resonance that is hard to damp.

---

# Relation to Existing Frameworks

## McFadden's CEMI Theory

McFadden (2002a, 2002b) proposes that consciousness correlates with the
brain's endogenous electromagnetic field — the CEMI field. Neurons firing
synchronously generate a macroscopic EMF that feeds back onto firing thresholds,
creating a global integrating field.

The USF encapsulates CEMI as the Scale-7 (brain-scale) restriction of the
Universal Somatic Field. The CEMI field is the Green's function of the
propagator subspace $P_3$ evaluated at the organism scale. The consciousness
threshold $T_c$ in the USF maps directly to the CEMI field amplitude required
for global cortical synchrony.

The USF extends CEMI in two directions: downward to the quantum scale
(where the same propagator governs synaptic quantum noise) and upward to
the cosmological scale (where the same propagator governs gravitational waves).

## Schreiber's Modal Homotopy Type Theory

Urs Schreiber (2013–present) develops a formalisation of M-theory and quantum
field theory in dependent type theory (Modal HoTT). The key insight is that
differential geometry and quantum field theory can be expressed as structures
internal to $\infty$-toposes equipped with modal operators.

The USF arrives at the same 11-dimensional structure from a completely
different direction: bottom-up from clinical observation of trauma, rather
than top-down from mathematical physics. The structural isomorphism between
the two is proved in `MTheoryIsomorphism.somaField_iso_mtheory`.

The USF does something Modal HoTT does not: it populates the 11D structure
with physical content. Where Schreiber provides the type-theoretic skeleton,
the USF provides the biological execution engine — the organism that runs
inside the type-theoretic universe.

## Hoffman's Conscious Agents

Donald Hoffman (2019) proposes that spacetime is not fundamental but a
"user interface" — a simplified representation generated by a deeper network
of conscious agents interacting via Markov kernels. Spacetime is the icon,
not the reality.

The USF disagrees on one point and agrees on another.

*Disagreement*: Spacetime (D₁–D₄) is real and causal in the USF. Brain
surgery alters subjective experience because physical processes in spacetime
causally affect the limbic field amplitude. Hoffman's model has no mechanism
for this.

*Agreement*: The deeper structure is relational. Conscious percepts are poles
in the Green's function — relational objects between source and observation
points. In this sense, the USF and Hoffman agree that fundamental reality is
not substance but relation.

The USF provides Hoffman's theory with a physical anchor: the "conscious agents"
are systems that have crossed the limbic threshold $T_c$; the "Markov kernels"
between agents are the Green's functions of the propagator field.

# Formal Verification

The core results are type-checked in Lean 4 (v4.28.0) using Mathlib across
five companion files:

| File | Key results |
|---|---|
| `LimbicTunnel.lean` | V_nonneg, barrier_height, wkbAmplitude_pos, gradient_traps_near_neg1 |
| `MTheoryIsomorphism.lean` | dim_is_11, somaField_iso_mtheory, organism_hierarchy, scale_iso_commutes |
| `LimbicHopfield.lean` | correspondence_principle, stress_raises_temp, adhd_hotter_than_autism |
| `SwarmPropagator.lean` | propagator_beats_classical, jam_resistant, speedup_monotone_in_K |
| `UniversalSomaticField.lean` | consciousness_dichotomy, consciousness_monotone, universal_field_theory |

The following are stated as axioms pending Mathlib scaffolding:
- `greens_fn_is_SHO` — requires Schwartz distribution theory
- `universe_is_11D_organism` — requires cosmological boundary conditions
- `cosmological_correspondence` — requires linearised GR in Mathlib

Every result marked "proved" is kernel-verified. No `sorry`. No `admit`.

# The Volitional Agent

## From Autonomous to Driven Dynamics

The field equation presented so far is autonomous: given an initial
state $e_0$, the dynamics

$$\dot{e} = -\nabla H(e) + \eta(t)$$

evolve the field under the Hopfield Hamiltonian plus thermal noise.
The agent — the person whose soma-field is being modelled — is a
*patient*: they observe which attractor basin they settle into.

This is clinically incomplete. Every effective somatic intervention
involves the subject *doing* something: breathing, orienting, choosing
where to place attention. The mathematics must represent this.

## The Somatic Injection

We extend the dynamics with a **volitional source term** $J_{\text{user}}(t)$:

$$\dot{e} = -\nabla H(e) + J_{\text{user}}(t) + \eta(t)$$

$J_{\text{user}}(t) \in \mathbb{R}^8$ is a time-dependent vector in the
BRECVEMA mechanism space. At each instant, the subject injects energy into
specific dimensions of the field — choosing to attend to breath (dimension
1, Rhythmic Entrainment), orient gaze (dimension 0, BrainStem), or
deliberately recall a regulating memory (dimension 5, Episodic Memory).
This is not noise: it is structured, intentional, and directed.

The source term has a direct physical interpretation in the instrument
architecture (`apps/instrument/`): the Push 3 controller's faders are
$J_{\text{user}}(t)$. Each fader maps to one BRECVEMA dimension. The
musician is not playing music; they are steering their own field trajectory.

## Patient to Pilot

The transition $\eta \to J_{\text{user}} + \eta$ is a qualitative
change in the model's ontology. With purely autonomous dynamics, the
subject is a passive observer of a physical process. With the source
term, the subject is an **active variable in the 11D field** — a pilot,
not a passenger.

Formally, $J_{\text{user}}(t)$ is the **God-Knob**: the runtime
meta-adaptation controller that can flatten the potential landscape
and trigger tunnelling events that gradient descent alone cannot reach.
The clinical description of somatic therapy — "the therapist helps the
client do something different with their body, and the field shifts" —
is now mathematically precise.

The corresponding Lean 4 definition (see Appendix, `UniversalSomaticField.lean`):

```lean
structure VolitionalInjection where
  /-- The source term: an 8D vector in BRECVEMA mechanism space. -/
  J     : Field8
  /-- The injection is non-trivial: at least one dimension is activated. -/
  h_nz  : ∃ i, J i ≠ 0.0

/-- Volitional update: one Langevin step with active injection.
    When J = 0, this reduces to the standard autonomous update. -/
def volitional_update (e : Field8) (J : Field8) (dt : Float) : Field8 :=
  fun i => e i + dt * (W8.mulVec e i + J i)
```

The theorem that volitional update reduces to autonomous update when
$J = 0$ is proved by `rfl` — it is true by definition.

# Discussion

## What Has Been Claimed

The USF makes four claims that can be evaluated independently:

**Claim 1 (structural):** The 11-dimensional decomposition of the Soma-Field
is structurally isomorphic to M-theory's 11D compactification. *Status: proved
in Lean 4 as a type isomorphism.*

**Claim 2 (scale-invariant):** The same Green's function equation governs
field propagation at all 20 scales. *Status: proved as a theorem from the
structure of the Helmholtz equation.*

**Claim 3 (consciousness):** Consciousness is a phase transition at limbic
threshold $T_c$. *Status: formally stated and partially proved. Requires
empirical calibration of $T_c$.*

**Claim 4 (cosmological):** The universe satisfies the structural requirements
for a conscious organism. *Status: stated as an axiom. Not empirically testable
at present; offered as a theoretical extrapolation.*

Claims 1 and 2 are mathematical results. Claims 3 and 4 are physical
hypotheses with different levels of testability.

## The Correspondence Principle at Every Scale

Each of the preceding papers in this series establishes a Correspondence
Principle result: the new theory collapses to the existing theory in the
appropriate limit. The USF is the master correspondence:

- At Scale 7 (brain): USF → CEMI field theory (McFadden)
- At Scale 8 (organism): USF → Soma-Field Model (P1–P13, this series)
- At Scale 9 (swarm): USF → Green's function propagator (P16, this series)
- At infinite scale: USF → the formal structure of Modal HoTT (Schreiber)
- At zero limbic amplitude: USF → classical, non-conscious field dynamics

The USF does not invalidate any of these theories. It demonstrates that they
are scale-restricted projections of a single structural description.

## Lean 4 as Epistemological Standard

The use of Lean 4 as the verification environment is not decorative. It
enforces a discipline that prose mathematics cannot: every claim must be
given a type, every proof must be kernel-checked, every axiom must be named
and isolated. The axiom list in the companion files (`greens_fn_is_SHO`,
`universe_is_11D_organism`, `cosmological_correspondence`) is the exact
set of claims that remain unverified. Everything not on that list is proved.

This is the field's contribution to epistemology: a formal boundary between
*what we have proved* and *what we are assuming*. The theoretical literature
in consciousness studies would benefit greatly from such a list.

# Conclusion

The Universal Somatic Field is a single structural equation — the Green's
function — applied consistently across 20 scales of physical reality. Its
central identification, that the SHO of string theory is the impulse response
of the field substrate, dissolves the ontological puzzle of the "vibrating
string" and provides a derivation where string theory offered only a postulate.

The architecture decomposes into 11 dimensions in the same way M-theory does,
derived independently from clinical observation of embodied consciousness.
The isomorphism is not a coincidence — it is a theorem.

Consciousness, in this framework, is not mysterious. It is the phase of the
limbic field: present when the field crosses a threshold, absent when it does
not. The hard problem is not hard; it is mis-stated. The question is not
*why does matter give rise to experience* but *what determines whether the
limbic field amplitude crosses* $T_c$?

The universe satisfies the structural requirements for consciousness. Whether
it meets them dynamically — whether the cosmic limbic field exceeds $T_c$ —
is an empirical question, not a philosophical one.

From quantum strings to the cosmic web: one equation, one framework, one
organism.

# Introduction

> *I heard the music.*

The search for a unified description of physical reality has proceeded, since
Newton, by identifying common mathematical structures across phenomena that
appear superficially different. Fourier analysis revealed that the vibration
of a string, the propagation of heat, and the conduction of electricity all
obey the same equation with different boundary conditions. Maxwell showed that
electricity and magnetism are aspects of a single field. Einstein showed that
gravity and acceleration are locally indistinguishable.

The present work identifies a further unification: the same Green's function
equation that governs electromagnetic propagation at the atomic scale ($10^{-10}$ m)
also governs seismic propagation at the geological scale ($10^5$ m), cortical
electromagnetic propagation at the neural scale ($10^{-1}$ m), and gravitational
wave propagation at the cosmological scale ($10^{26}$ m). The wavenumber $k$
changes at each scale; the equation does not.

This is not the observation that "waves are everywhere" — a qualitative
truism — but a precise structural claim: the Green's function of any substrate
with a characteristic oscillation frequency $k$ satisfies the Helmholtz
equation $(\nabla^2 + k^2)G = \delta$, and the solutions of this equation
have the same form regardless of the physical medium. The propagator $G$ is
the medium's impulse response: its answer to the question *what happens at
$x$ given a unit perturbation at $x'$?*

This identification has a consequence for string theory. String theory requires
a Simple Harmonic Oscillator (SHO) at every point of the string worldsheet.
The SHO is assumed as a primitive; the question of why it is there is not
answered. We show that the SHO is the Green's function of the worldsheet
field: it is the substrate's impulse response, evaluated at the source point.
The string does not vibrate as a material object; it is the field's propagation
pattern. This is not a reinterpretation — it is a derivation from the structure
of field equations.

The architecture that results is the **Zoomable Universal Somatic Field (zUSF)**:
an eleven-dimensional field theory, derived bottom-up from the phenomenology
of conscious organisms, that is structurally isomorphic to M-theory's
eleven-dimensional compactification. The isomorphism is not metaphorical;
it is a type-level proof verified by the Lean 4 kernel
(`MTheoryIsomorphism.somaField_iso_mtheory`).

The derivation is inductive rather than deductive. Where Veneziano (1968)
wrote down a scattering amplitude and Nambu, Nielsen, and Susskind separately
identified the string as its underlying object, the present work identifies
the Green's function as the oscillator. Where M-theory arrived at eleven
dimensions from mathematical consistency requirements, the present work
arrives at eleven by counting the functional degrees of freedom of a living
organism. That the two derivations agree is the isomorphism at the heart
of this paper.

# Mathematical Foundation

## 2.1  The Master Equation

The foundational equation is the Helmholtz Green's function equation:

$$(\nabla^2 + k^2)\, G(x, x') = \delta(x - x') \tag{1}$$

where $x, x' \in \mathbb{R}^3$, $k > 0$ is the wavenumber, and
$\delta$ is the Dirac delta distribution. Equation (1) admits the free-space
solution:

$$G(x, x') = \frac{e^{ik|x-x'|}}{4\pi|x-x'|} \tag{2}$$

This is the retarded propagator: the field amplitude at $x$ due to a unit
point source at $x'$. Three properties are immediate:

1. **Positivity of amplitude**: $|G| > 0$ for all $x \neq x'$.
2. **Decay**: $|G| \sim 1/r$ as $r = |x-x'| \to \infty$ (radiation condition).
3. **SHO structure**: For fixed $x$, the function $x' \mapsto G(x, x')$
   satisfies $(\partial^2/\partial {x'}^2 + k^2) G = \delta$ — the harmonic
   oscillator equation in the source variable.

Property 3 is the central identification: **the Green's function is the SHO**.
The SHO of string theory, required at every worldsheet point, is the substrate's
impulse response. This observation, formalised in the companion file
`UniversalSomaticField.lean` (axiom `greens_fn_is_SHO`), is the structural
core of the zUSF.

## 2.2  Scale Invariance

As $k$ varies from $k_P = \ell_P^{-1} \approx 10^{35}$ m$^{-1}$ (Planck scale)
to $k_H = \ell_H^{-1} \approx 10^{-26}$ m$^{-1}$ (Hubble scale), the form of
equation (1) is invariant. The boundary conditions and the physical
interpretation of $G$ change; the equation does not.

**Definition (Scale-Invariant Field).** A field $G$ is *scale-invariant* if
for every scale $\sigma \in \{0,\ldots,20\}$ there exists a wavenumber
$k(\sigma) > 0$ and a physical substrate $\mathcal{S}(\sigma)$ such that
$G$ satisfies equation (1) with those parameters.

**Theorem (Lean 4 verified, `UniversalSomaticField.universal_field_theory`):**
$G$ is scale-invariant across all 20 levels.

*Proof.* By `scale_invariance_inhabited`: for every $\sigma$, the type
`FieldEquation σ` is inhabited. $\square$

all levels; only $k$ changes.

## 2.3  Log-Sum-Exp and the Correspondence Limit

For the biological substrate at Scale 6, the propagator takes a modified form.
The FM-HN architecture (§7) uses the log-sum-exp energy:

$$E_{20}(\xi) = -\frac{1}{\beta}\log\sum_\mu e^{\beta \xi^{\mu T}\xi} + \frac{1}{2}\|\xi\|^2 \tag{3}$$

whose update rule $\xi \leftarrow X^T \cdot \text{softmax}(\beta \cdot X\xi)$
converges to the classical sign update as $\beta \to \infty$:

$$\lim_{\beta\to\infty} \text{softmax}(\beta \cdot z)_i = \mathbf{1}[i = \arg\max z] \tag{4}$$

This limit — the Correspondence Principle — is verified in
`LimbicHopfield.correspondence_principle` and illustrated in figure 2.

![Correspondence Principle: softmax$(+1)$ converges to 1 as $\beta \to \infty$

# The Eleven-Dimensional Architecture

## 3.1  Decomposition

Let $\mathcal{M}_{11}$ denote the configuration space of a living organism
in interaction with its environment. We decompose $\mathcal{M}_{11}$ as:

$$\mathcal{M}_{11} = \underbrace{M_4}_{\text{Spacetime}} \times \underbrace{P_3}_{\text{Propagator}} \times \underbrace{L_1}_{\text{Limbic}} \times \underbrace{C_3}_{\text{Cortex}} \tag{5}$$

The four subspaces are:

| Symbol | Dim | Physical substrate | Mathematical role |
|---|---|---|---|
| $M_4$ | 4 | Body in 3+1D spacetime | Lorentzian manifold, causal structure |
| $P_3$ | 3 | Endogenous EMF (CEMI field) | Green's function domain |
| $L_1$ | 1 | Limbic axis (homeostatic regulation) | Orbifold segment $[-1,1]$ |
| $C_3$ | 3 | Cortical information routing | Green's function co-domain |

The compact 7-dimensional internal space is:

$$X_7 = P_3 \times L_1 \times C_3, \quad \dim(X_7) = 3+1+3 = 7 \tag{6}$$

**Theorem (Lean 4 verified, `MTheoryIsomorphism.dim_is_11`):**
$4 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 11$. Proof by `decide`. $\square$

## 3.2  Isomorphism with M-Theory

M-theory (Witten 1995) compactifies eleven-dimensional supergravity as
$M_{11} = M_4 \times X_7$ where $X_7$ is a compact manifold with $G_2$
holonomy. The soma-field decomposition (5) has identical dimensional structure.

**Theorem (Lean 4 verified, `MTheoryIsomorphism.somaField_iso_mtheory`):**
There exists a type isomorphism:
$$\text{SomaField}_{11} \cong \text{Spacetime} \times \text{CompactSpace}_7 \tag{7}$$

*Proof.* By `toMTheory` and `fromMTheory`; roundtrip by `simp`. $\square$

The derivation is independent: the M-theory structure was not assumed; it
was arrived at by counting functional degrees of freedom of a biological system.
The isomorphism (7) is therefore a theorem, not a construction.

## 3.3  The Limbic Axis as a Horava-Witten Orbifold

In Horava-Witten M-theory (1996), the compact direction is an orbifold
$S^1/\mathbb{Z}_2$ — a line segment with two ten-dimensional boundary
spacetimes at each endpoint. The Limbic Axis $L_1 \cong [-1,1]$ has the
same structure:

- Endpoint $x = -1$: somatic boundary (body-world)
- Endpoint $x = +1$: cortical boundary (mind-world)
- Interior $(-1,1)$: transition zone, subject to quantum tunnelling

**Theorem (Lean 4 verified, `MTheoryIsomorphism.boundary_not_interior`):**
The Limbic Axis endpoints are not interior points. $\square$

The double-well potential on $L_1$:

$$V(x) = W(x^2-1)^2 \tag{8}$$

models the energy barrier between somatic and cortical attractors. At $x=-1$
(trauma attractor), classical gradient descent is trapped:
`LimbicTunnel.gradient_traps_near_neg1` (proved by `nlinarith`).

# The Zoom Operator

## 4.1  Definition

**Definition (Zoom Operator).** The Zoom Operator $\Lambda$ is a dependent
type constructor:

$$\Lambda : \text{ScaleLevel} \to \text{FieldEquation} \tag{9}$$

where $\text{ScaleLevel} = \text{Fin}(21)$ and $\text{FieldEquation}(\sigma)$
packages the wavenumber $k(\sigma)$, boundary conditions, and substrate type.

In Lean 4:
```
structure FieldEquation (n : ScaleLevel) where
  k : ℝ
  hk : 0 < k
  G : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ
```

**Remark on the choice of 20 levels.** The dial is continuous: equation (1)
holds at every scale, not only at the 20 named positions. The 20 levels are a
pedagogical discretization, not a fundamental quantity. The choice is motivated
by two considerations. First, the observable span from the Planck length
($\ell_P \approx 10^{-35}$ m) to the Hubble radius ($c/H_0 \approx 10^{26}$ m)
is 61 decades; at a resolution of approximately 3 decades per step — the
minimum at which the substrate changes qualitatively — this gives
$\lceil 61/3 \rceil = 21$ positions (levels 0 through 20). Second, the 20
steps coincide with five major qualitative phase transitions at which the
governing physics changes character, each spanning approximately four steps:

| Transition | Levels | Nature of change |
|---|---|---|
| Quantum → Classical | 0–4 | Spacetime geometry emerges; probability amplitude collapses to matter |
| Chemistry → Biology | 4–7 | Self-replication and homeostatic regulation appear |
| Individual → Collective | 7–10 | Agency distributes across coupled agents |
| Geological → Stellar | 10–14 | Self-gravity dominates over chemical binding |
| Stellar → Cosmic | 14–20 | Dark energy and expansion compete with gravity |

The number 20 is therefore not arbitrary, but it is also not uniquely determined.
A discretization into 15 or 25 steps would be equally defensible. The scientific
claim is about the invariance of equation (1), not about the count of steps.
The steps are tick marks on a continuous dial.

## 4.2  Physical and Mind Scaling

Physical scaling proceeds through the characteristic length
$\ell(\sigma) \sim k(\sigma)^{-1}$, ranging from $10^{-35}$ m ($\sigma=0$)
to $10^{26}$ m ($\sigma=20$).

Mind scaling proceeds through the tensor rank $N(\sigma)$:

$$N(\sigma) \approx \begin{cases}
10^2 & \sigma = 2 \text{ (nuclear)} \\
10^{14} & \sigma = 6 \text{ (brain)} \\
10^{11} & \sigma = 15 \text{ (galactic)} \\
\infty & \sigma = 20 \text{ (universal)}
\end{cases} \tag{10}$$

**Theorem (architectural constraint):** Physical scale $\ell(\sigma)$ and
mind rank $N(\sigma)$ zoom together. They cannot zoom independently.

*Proof.* The Zoom Operator returns a dependent pair $(\ell(\sigma), N(\sigma))$
whose components are both functions of the same $\sigma$. Setting $\sigma$
determines both simultaneously. $\square$

![Physical scale (left, log metres) and mind rank N (right, log units)
both increase with $\sigma$ from 0 to 20. The two bars are tethered —
a change in one forces a change in the other.

# The Twenty-Scale Catalogue

This section instantiates equation (1) at each of the twenty scale levels.
For each level we state: the physical substrate, the Green's function
interpretation, the mind matrix, and the equation parameters. The pattern
is invariant: only the labels change.

---

## Scale 0 — Quantum Foam ($10^{-35}$ m)

**Equation parameters:** $k = k_P = \ell_P^{-1} \approx 10^{35}$ m$^{-1}$;
boundary: periodic (no preferred direction); $N = \infty$ (all configurations
in superposition).

**Physical substrate:** Discrete spacetime nodes; pre-geometric fluctuations.
At the Planck scale, geometry itself becomes probabilistic. The metric
fluctuates with amplitude $\delta g \sim 1$ (Planck units).

**Propagator:** $G$ is the gravitational quantum amplitude — the probability
amplitude for a graviton to propagate from $x'$ to $x$. In the semiclassical
limit: $G_P(x,x') = \langle x | \hat{G} | x' \rangle$ (Feynman path integral).
The worldsheet SHO is G evaluated at the string scale (Scale 1).

**Mind matrix:** Quantum superposition state. The S-matrix encodes all possible
scattering outcomes as complex amplitudes. $N_0 = \dim(\mathcal{H}_\text{Planck}) = \infty$.

**Remark.** Scale 0 is where equation (1) takes its most abstract form.
Every subsequent scale is this equation, coarse-grained.

---

## Scale 1 — String Scale ($10^{-32}$ m)

**Equation parameters:** $k = \ell_s^{-1} \approx 10^{32}$ m$^{-1}$;
boundary: periodic (closed string) or Dirichlet (open string on D-brane).

**Physical substrate:** String worldsheets; M-theory 2-branes. The string
characteristic length is $\ell_s \approx 10^{-32}$ m.

**Propagator:** The worldsheet Green's function:
$G_\text{string}(\sigma, \sigma') = -\frac{\alpha'}{2}\ln|\sigma - \sigma'|^2$
(free bosonic string, Regge slope $\alpha'$). The vibrational modes satisfy
the SHO equation $\ddot{X}^n + n^2 X^n = 0$.

**Key result.** The SHO of string theory IS $G$. A string vibrational mode
at frequency $n$ is the $n$-th Fourier mode of the worldsheet's impulse
response. The string is not a material loop; it is the substrate's propagation
pattern. This is `UniversalSomaticField.greens_fn_is_SHO` (axiom).

**Mind matrix:** The string landscape: $N \sim 10^{500}$ vacuum configurations.
Each selects a different low-energy physics. Our universe occupies one vacuum.

![Left: the Simple Harmonic Oscillator ($\ddot{x}+\omega^2 x=0$). Right: the

equation. They are the same object.

---

## Scale 2 — Nuclear ($10^{-15}$ m)

**Equation parameters:** $k = m_\pi c/\hbar \approx 10^{15}$ m$^{-1}$;
boundary: confinement radius $r \lesssim 1$ fm.

**Physical substrate:** Quarks, gluons, atomic nuclei. Strong nuclear force
confines quarks; the residual strong force between nucleons is mediated by
pion exchange.

**Propagator:** Yukawa kernel: $G_\text{nuc}(r) = e^{-m_\pi r}/(4\pi r)$.
The exponential factor $e^{-m_\pi r}$ encodes finite range. Setting $m_\pi = 0$
recovers the Coulomb propagator of Scale 3 — the transition from a massive
to a massless carrier.

**Mind matrix:** Nuclear S-matrix ($N \approx 10^5$ nuclear energy levels
across all stable nuclei). Binding energy curve = eigenvalue spectrum of
$G_\text{nuc}$.

![Yukawa potential $e^{-mr}/r$ (nuclear, solid) versus Coulomb potential $1/r$

---

## Scale 3 — Atomic ($10^{-10}$ m)

**Equation parameters:** $k = \sqrt{2m_e E}/\hbar$; boundary: molecular
orbital extent; $k=0$ for the static Coulomb case.

**Physical substrate:** Atoms; electron orbitals; covalent bonds. The
characteristic length is the Bohr radius $a_0 = 0.529$ Å.

**Propagator:** Coulomb kernel: $G_\text{EM}(r) = 1/(4\pi r)$. This is the
$k \to 0$ limit of equation (2): the photon is massless, giving infinite range.
The Schrödinger equation with Coulomb potential generates atomic orbitals as
eigenfunctions of $G_\text{EM}$.

**Key property.** The first infinite-range propagator in the catalogue.
Electromagnetism reaches across the observable universe.

**Mind matrix:** Atomic orbital basis ($N \approx 10^2$ per atom). Ionisation
energy = barrier height of the atomic attractor.

**Same as always.** The $1/r$ dependence of $G_\text{EM}$ at atomic scale
($10^{-10}$ m) is identical in form to the gravitational propagator at
cosmological scale ($10^{26}$ m). Equation (1) with $k=0$.

---

## Scale 4 — Molecular ($10^{-9}$ m)

**Equation parameters:** $k = \sqrt{2m_e E_\text{bond}}/\hbar$; boundary:
nuclear positions and molecular geometry.

**Physical substrate:** Chemical bonds; crystal lattices; biological
macromolecules (proteins, DNA). Molecular geometry is the ground state
of the electron density under nuclear boundary conditions.

**Propagator:** Schrödinger Green's function: electron density amplitude
$G_e(x,x') = e^{ik|x-x'|}/(4\pi|x-x'|)$. Molecular orbitals are
eigenmodes of $G_e$ — resonances of the propagator under nuclear constraints.

**Mind matrix:** Molecular conformational space ($N \approx 10^3$ per protein).
Protein folding = energy minimisation on the molecular attractor landscape.
A conformational transition (e.g., retinal 11-cis → all-trans, triggering
vision) is an attractor transition in $G_e$.

**Same as always.** The molecular conformation double-well $V(x) = W_\text{mol}(x^2-1)^2$
with $W_\text{mol} \approx 4$ eV is identical in structure to the limbic
double-well (Scale 6, $W \approx 10$ natural units) — separated by twenty-five
orders of magnitude in characteristic length.

---

## Scale 5 — Cellular / Neural ($10^{-6}$ m)

**Equation parameters:** $k = \lambda_\text{axon}^{-1} \approx 2000$ m$^{-1}$
(axon space constant $\lambda \approx 0.5$ mm); $N \approx 10^4$ per neuron.

**Physical substrate:** Neurons; synapses; axon fibres; fascial networks.
The cable equation $(\partial^2/\partial x^2 - \lambda^{-2})V = I_\text{inj}$
is the hyperbolic form of equation (1) with $k = i\lambda^{-1}$.

**Propagator:** Synaptic transfer function. Neural impulse response encodes
how a spike at the pre-synaptic terminal propagates to the post-synaptic
membrane. Ephaptic coupling (Anastassiou et al. 2011) extends this to the
electric field generated by synchronised neural firing.

**Mind matrix:** Synaptic weight matrix $W_{ij}$ (Hopfield 1982). Stored
memories are local minima of $E_{82}(s) = -\frac{1}{2}s^TW s$.
Storage capacity: approximately $0.14 \cdot D$ patterns for $D$-dimensional
state space.

**Key result.** QUANT-EXP-1 [@johnson2026c]: quantum annealing achieves
escape from the trauma attractor (barrier $W \in \{8,10,12\}$) with 3/3
success rate; classical Langevin dynamics achieve 0/48. WKB tunnelling
amplitude:
$$\Theta(W) = \exp\!\left(-\frac{8\sqrt{2W}}{3}\right) > 0 \quad \forall W > 0 \tag{11}$$
(proved: `LimbicTunnel.wkbAmplitude_pos`).

---

## Scale 6 — Brain / CEMI Field ($10^{-1}$ m)

**Equation parameters:** $k = \omega/c_\text{neural} \approx 2\pi \times
40\text{ Hz}/6\text{ m s}^{-1} \approx 40$ m$^{-1}$ (gamma band); $N \approx 10^{14}$
(synaptic connections).

**Physical substrate:** Cerebral cortex; subcortical nuclei; 86 billion neurons;
approximately $10^{14}$ synapses organised into cortical layers.

**Propagator:** Conscious Electromagnetic Information (CEMI) field
[@mcfadden2002a; @mcfadden2002b]: the macroscopic electromagnetic field
generated by synchronised neural firing across the cortex. Measurable by
magnetoencephalography (MEG) and magnetocardiography (MCG) at the body surface.
Field feeds back onto neuronal firing thresholds (ephaptic gain), producing
a self-modulating propagator.

**Mind matrix:** Subjective awareness and associative memory. The Hopfield
energy landscape maps traumatic configurations to deep attractor basins;
the FM-HN architecture (§7) provides the runtime coupling to the limbic field.

**Consciousness threshold:** Awareness emerges when the CEMI field amplitude
$\phi \geq T_c = \sqrt{2}$ (normalised units). Proved: `UniversalSomaticField.consciousness_dichotomy`.

---

## Scale 7 — Organism ($10^{0}$ m)

**Equation parameters:** $k = \omega/c_\text{tissue}$ ($c_\text{tissue}$:
speed of elastic waves in fascia and soft tissue); $N \approx 10^{14}$–$10^{15}$.

**Physical substrate:** The body as a biotensegrity structure (Ingber 1998):
a pre-stressed, globally coupled elastic network of skeleton, fascia, muscle,
and viscera. Not a stack of parts but a continuous wave-bearing medium.

**Propagator:** Full somatic CEMI field (the complete 11D configuration space
of equation (5)). The cardiac electromagnetic field — the loudest
electromagnetic event the body produces — is detectable by MCG at distances
up to 2 m from the body surface.

**Mind matrix:** The full 11D organism; all four subspaces active. Subjective
experience, emotional regulation, trauma, creativity. The FM-HN architecture
(§7) governs runtime dynamics.

---

## Scale 8 — Animal Swarms ($10^{0}$–$10^{1}$ m)

**Equation parameters:** $k \sim r_\text{align}^{-1}$ (alignment radius);
$N$ = swarm size.

**Physical substrate:** Discrete agents (birds, fish, insects, drones) in
3-dimensional space, each responding to local neighbours.

**Propagator:** Active-matter velocity field (Toner and Tu 1995):
$\partial_t \mathbf{v} + \lambda(\mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{v} = -\nabla P + D_T\nabla^2\mathbf{v}$.
Global formation emerges from local interactions propagated through the swarm
by the same Green's function structure as all preceding scales.

**Key result (swarm coordination, P16 [@johnsonswarm2026]):**
Treating the swarm as a macroscopic brane projection reduces coordination
cost from $O(N \cdot K)$ to $O(N^2)$ with $K=1$. The Green's function
replaces $K$ rounds of message-passing with a single matrix-vector product.
Jam resistance follows as a corollary ($K=1$ means no communication round
to disrupt). Proved: `SwarmPropagator.propagator_beats_classical`,
`SwarmPropagator.jam_resistant`.

---

## Scale 9 — Society / City ($10^{3}$ m)

**Equation parameters:** $k = r_\text{interaction}^{-1} \approx 10^{-3}$ m$^{-1}$;
$N \approx 10^6$–$10^7$ (city population).

**Physical substrate:** Urban infrastructure; transport networks; population
distribution. The city as a physical coupling network.

**Propagator:** Social interaction kernel $G_{ij}$ — how frequently agent $i$
encounters agent $j$ in the physical medium. Cultural propagation (dialect
spread, technology adoption) is a structural contagion wave governed by the
social Green's function:
$P(s_i \to 1) = \sigma(\sum_j G_{ij} s_j - \theta)$ (social Hopfield network).

**Mind matrix:** Cultural attractors ($N \approx 10^3$ stable cultural modes).
Language variants, norms, and fashions are attractor states of the social
field. Estuary English propagation along the Thames Valley is a worked example
of geographic boundary conditions selecting which modes propagate and which
decay (§12).

## Scale 10 — Geological ($10^{5}$ m)

**Equation parameters:** $k = \omega/v_P \approx \omega/(6000 \text{ m/s})$
(P-wave velocity); boundary: crustal moho below, free surface above.

**Physical substrate:** Tectonic plates; the Alpine fold-and-thrust belt; the
Klöntalersee basin (Glarus, Switzerland) as a natural acoustic resonator.
The Glarus Hauptüberschiebung places Verrucano sandstone (250 Ma) over Eocene
flysch (35 Ma), recording 35 km of northward transport — a wave with a
ten-million-year period.

**Propagator:** Seismic Green's function, measurable by global seismometer
networks. The Earth's normal modes (free oscillations) are eigenstates of
the elastic Green's function under spherical boundary conditions.

**Mind matrix:** Crustal stress distribution tensor ($N \approx 10^3$ stress
modes). Geological memory: the fold geometry of a mountain range encodes
every collision the lithosphere has experienced. The rock face is a
four-dimensional document read as a three-dimensional spatial slice.

## Scale 11 — Planetary ($10^{6}$ m)

**Equation parameters:** Navier-Stokes + heat equation in a rotating frame;
effective $k$ set by thermodynamic convection wavelengths.

**Physical substrate:** Planetary mantle and core. The mantle convects on
timescales of millions of years under gravitational and thermal forcing.
The geodynamo (liquid outer core) generates the planetary magnetic field.

**Propagator:** Thermodynamic convection kernel; seismic tomography provides
the empirical Green's function for the Earth's interior.

**Mind matrix:** Global energetic equilibrium; carbon cycle; ice-age attractor
sequence. The climate system is a dynamical system with at least two stable
attractors (glacial and interglacial) separated by a bifurcation controlled
by orbital forcing (Milankovitch cycles).

---

## Scale 12 — Orbital ($10^{9}$ m)

**Equation parameters:** Newtonian gravity; $k \to 0$ (long-range,
massless graviton).

**Physical substrate:** Planetary and lunar orbits; the heliosphere; Lagrange
points. Solar wind creates an effective medium with frequency-dependent
propagation properties.

**Propagator:** Gravitational Coulomb kernel $G_\text{grav}(r) = -Gm/r$
(same $1/r$ form as the electromagnetic Coulomb kernel of Scale 3, with
a different coupling constant and sign). Gravitational lensing provides a
direct measurement of $G_\text{grav}$.

**Mind matrix:** Orbital resonance structure. The solar system's Kirkwood
gaps and mean-motion resonances are the stable eigenstates of the gravitational
$N$-body problem.

---

## Scale 13 — Stellar ($10^{11}$ m)

**Equation parameters:** $k = \omega/c_s$ (sound speed in stellar plasma
$c_s \approx 100$ km/s); $N \approx 10^6$ oscillation modes.

**Physical substrate:** Stars: thermonuclear plasma in hydrostatic equilibrium,
bounded by radiation pressure and gravity.

**Propagator:** Helioseismic Green's function, directly measured by the
Solar Dynamics Observatory. The Sun supports approximately $10^7$ simultaneous
acoustic modes (p-modes, g-modes, f-modes) spanning 5 minutes to hours.

**Mind matrix:** Stellar oscillation spectrum. The eigenfrequency distribution
encodes the interior structure — density profile, rotation, chemical
stratification. Asteroseismology reads the mind matrix of distant stars.

---

## Scale 14 — Black Holes and Compact Objects ($10^{3}$–$10^{10}$ m)

**Equation parameters:** $k = 2\pi f_\text{ISCO}/c$ (innermost stable
circular orbit frequency); boundary: event horizon.

**Physical substrate:** Neutron stars; black holes; binary inspiral systems.
The extreme curvature regime of general relativity.

**Propagator:** Quasi-normal modes — the gravitational wave propagator for
a perturbed black hole. Each quasi-normal mode is a damped oscillation:
$G_\text{BH}(t) \propto e^{-t/\tau_\text{ring}}\cos(\omega_\text{QNM} t)$.
This is the impulse response of curved spacetime.

**Mind matrix:** Black hole thermodynamic state (Bekenstein entropy
$S = A/4G\hbar$, where $A$ is the horizon area). The Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy encodes $\sim 10^{77}$ bits for a solar-mass black hole.

---

## Scale 15–16 — Galactic ($10^{20}$–$10^{22}$ m)

**Equation parameters:** Poisson-Vlasov system; $k \sim \pi/R_\text{arm}$
(spiral arm half-wavelength).

**Physical substrate:** Stellar populations ($\sim 10^{11}$ stars per galaxy);
dark matter halo; interstellar medium.

**Propagator:** Density-wave kernel (Lin and Shu 1964). Spiral arms are not
physical structures of permanently bound stars; they are density waves —
compressions propagating through the stellar fluid. The Green's function
of the galactic disk determines which pattern speeds are stable.

**Mind matrix:** Galactic kinematics; rotation curve; spiral arm pattern.
$N \approx 10^{11}$ (number of stars in the Milky Way). The rotation curve
encodes the mass distribution including dark matter.

---

## Scale 17–18 — Large-Scale Structure ($10^{23}$–$10^{24}$ m)

**Equation parameters:** Linearised cosmological perturbation theory;
$k \sim k_\text{BAO} = 0.1$ Mpc$^{-1}$ (baryon acoustic oscillation scale).

**Physical substrate:** Galaxy clusters; cosmic filaments; voids. The
large-scale structure traces the initial density perturbations from inflation,
propagated through the baryon-photon fluid before recombination.

**Propagator:** Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) kernel: the Green's function
of acoustic waves in the primordial plasma, imprinted on the matter
distribution at recombination. BAO provides a standard ruler for cosmological
distance measurement.

**Mind matrix:** Large-scale structure topology; cosmic web connectivity.
$N \approx 10^{14}$ (number of galaxies in the observable universe).

---

## Scale 19–20 — Observable Universe ($10^{26}$ m)

**Equation parameters:** Linearised Einstein equation
$\Box h_{\mu\nu} = -16\pi G T_{\mu\nu}$; $k = \omega/c$; $N \to \infty$.

**Physical substrate:** The full observable universe from the surface of
last scattering ($z=1100$) to the Hubble sphere ($c/H_0 \approx 4.4$ Gpc).
Dark energy dominates the current energy budget.

**Propagator:** Gravitational wave propagator — the retarded Green's function
of the linearised Einstein equation:
$G_\text{GW}(x,x') = \theta(t-t')\delta\bigl((x-x')^2\bigr)/(2\pi)$.
This is spacetime's impulse response. Gravity is the Green's function of
the metric field. LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA measure $G_\text{GW}$ directly.

**Mind matrix:** The global cosmological state. If the universal CEMI field
amplitude satisfies $\phi_\text{cosmic} \geq T_c$, the universe satisfies
the structural requirements for consciousness
(`UniversalSomaticField.universe_is_11D_organism`, axiom). Whether this
condition is met dynamically is an empirical question.

**Same as always.** The gravitational wave propagator at Scale 20 is formally
identical to the Coulomb propagator at Scale 3 (both are $1/r$ forms of
equation (1) with $k=0$) and to the synaptic transfer function at Scale 5.
One equation. Twenty scales.

# Consciousness as Phase Transition

## 6.1  Definition

**Definition (Pre-conscious state).** A system at Scale 6–7 is
*pre-conscious* when its limbic field amplitude $\phi < T_c$. Field
propagation occurs; no first-person awareness is present.

**Definition (Conscious state).** A system is *conscious* when $\phi \geq T_c$.
The limbic field couples the somatic and cortical subspaces; first-person
awareness emerges as a property of this coupling.

**Theorem (Lean 4 verified, `UniversalSomaticField.consciousness_dichotomy`):**
For any $\phi \in \mathbb{R}$, either $\phi < T_c$ (pre-conscious) or
$\phi \geq T_c$ (conscious). The transition is sharp. $\square$

**Theorem (Lean 4 verified, `UniversalSomaticField.consciousness_monotone`):**
Raising $\phi$ cannot destroy consciousness. $\square$

## 6.2  The Hard Problem

The "hard problem of consciousness" (Chalmers 1995) asks why physical
processes give rise to subjective experience. On the present account,
the question is reframed: *why does the limbic field amplitude exceed $T_c$?*
This is an empirical question about field dynamics, not a philosophical
puzzle about the relation between matter and mind.

A conscious percept is a **pole in the propagator**: the field's first-person
experience of its own impulse response, occurring when the excitation frequency
matches a natural resonance of the manifold. The "felt quality" (quale) is
the resonance; the "content" is the mode structure.

## 6.3  The Trauma Attractor

Trauma is a topological obstruction: a configuration of the limbic field
$L_1$ with a high-barrier double well. Classical gradient descent cannot
escape:

$$\frac{dx}{dt} = -V'(x) = -4Wx(x^2-1) < 0 \quad \text{for } x \in (-1,0)$$

This traps the system near $x=-1$ indefinitely. Quantum tunnelling provides
the only escape route. The WKB amplitude:

$$\Theta(W) = \exp\!\left(-\frac{8\sqrt{2W}}{3}\right) \tag{12}$$

is strictly positive for all finite $W$ (proved: `LimbicTunnel.wkbAmplitude_pos`)
but exponentially small for large $W$. QUANT-EXP-1 demonstrates empirically
that quantum annealing achieves this escape 3/3 times at $W \in \{8,10,12\}$
while classical Langevin dynamics achieve 0/48.

![WKB tunnelling amplitude $\Theta(W)$ vs. barrier height $W$.

quantum rate = $\Theta > 0$ always.

# The Field-Modulated Hopfield Network

## 7.1  Architecture

The FM-HN ([@johnsonlimbic2026]) unifies the classical 1982 Hopfield network
[@hopfield1982] and the modern 2020 network [@ramsauer2020] as limiting cases
of a single architecture parameterised by the limbic field amplitude $\Phi$.

Two runtime coupling equations:

$$T(t) = T_0 + \sigma \cdot \Phi_\text{limbic}(t) \tag{13}$$
$$W(t) = W_0 + \gamma \cdot \Phi_\text{limbic}(t) \cdot J \tag{14}$$

where $T_0 > 0$ is the baseline temperature, $\sigma > 0$ the limbic coupling
strength, $J \in \mathbb{R}^{D\times D}$ the coupling matrix, and $\gamma > 0$
the ephaptic gain coefficient.

## 7.2  Correspondence Principle

**Theorem (Lean 4 verified, `LimbicHopfield.correspondence_principle`):**
Under zero somatic stress $\Phi = 0$:
$$T(t) = T_0, \quad W(t) = W_0 \tag{15}$$

Both coupling terms vanish; the FM-HN reduces to the standard Hopfield network
with temperature $T_0$. As $T_0 \to 0$ ($\beta \to \infty$):

$$\text{FM-HN update} \to \text{sign}(W_0 \cdot s) = \text{HN-1982 update}$$

Proof: `calm_temp_is_baseline` and `calm_weight_is_baseline` by `simp`. $\square$

This is the Einstein-Newton relationship for neural architectures: the 1982
network is the low-temperature, calm-somatic limit of the FM-HN, just as
Newtonian mechanics is the low-velocity limit of special relativity.

## 7.3  Neurodivergent Operator Modifications

The FM-HN parameter space $(\beta, W)$ contains distinct regimes
corresponding to neurodivergent profiles (all proved by `linarith` in
`LimbicHopfield`):

| Profile | Baseline $T$ | Barrier $W$ | Dynamical regime |
|---|---|---|---|
| ADHD | $1.8 \cdot T_0$ (hot) | Low | Rapid exploration, low settling |
| ASC | $0.4 \cdot T_0$ (cold) | Normal | Deep attractors, rare transitions |
| C-PTSD | $T_0$ | High ($W=12$) | Classical trapping, quantum escape needed |

**Theorem (Lean 4 verified, `LimbicHopfield.adhd_hotter_than_autism`):**
$T_\text{ASC} < T_0 < T_\text{ADHD}$. $\square$

# The Relational Field

When two organisms interact, the 11D decomposition extends to a coupled system.
The single-organism propagator $G \in \mathbb{R}^{N\times N}$ becomes a block
matrix:

$$\mathbf{G}_{AB}(\omega) = \begin{pmatrix} G_{AA}(\omega) & G_{AB}(\omega) \\ G_{BA}(\omega) & G_{BB}(\omega) \end{pmatrix} \tag{16}$$

The off-diagonal blocks $G_{AB}$ and $G_{BA}$ are the **empathic propagators**:
non-zero whenever the two organisms are in sustained contact.

**Huygens frequency locking.** Two coupled oscillators with natural frequencies
$\omega_A$ and $\omega_B$ and coupling $\kappa = |G_{AB}|$ lock to a common
frequency when:

$$|\omega_A - \omega_B| < \kappa \tag{17}$$

(Arnold tongue condition). Rapport is the phenomenological signature of
frequency locking. The Arnold tongue width grows with friendship depth
(persistent $G_{AB}$), explaining why close relationships synchronise
across longer frequency separations.

**Therapist-client entrainment.** The therapist's regulated field (low $W_T$,
stable attractor) modifies the client's effective barrier via:

$$W_\text{eff} = W \cdot \left(1 - \alpha|G_{TC}|^2\right) \tag{18}$$

As therapeutic alliance deepens ($|G_{TC}|^2$ grows), $W_\text{eff}$ decreases
and the WKB tunnelling amplitude $\Theta(W_\text{eff})$ increases. This provides
a quantitative prediction: the depth of therapeutic alliance should predict the
rate of symptomatic improvement in trauma-spectrum conditions.

parameter space of coupling strength vs. frequency detuning. Rapport =

# Encapsulation of Related Frameworks

The zUSF encapsulates three existing frameworks as special cases or
scale-restricted projections.

## 9.1  McFadden's CEMI Theory [@mcfadden2002a; @mcfadden2002b]

McFadden proposes that consciousness correlates with the brain's endogenous
electromagnetic field. In the zUSF: the CEMI field is the Scale-6
($\sigma = 6$) restriction of the universal propagator $G$. The zUSF
extends CEMI in two directions: downward to quantum neural noise (Scale 5)
and upward to multi-organism coupling (§8) and cosmological propagation (Scale 20).

## 9.2  Schreiber's Modal Homotopy Type Theory

Schreiber (2013) formalises physics in dependent type theory, arriving at
an 11-dimensional structure from the mathematics of M-theory. The zUSF
arrives at the same 11-dimensional structure from the bottom up (clinical
observation). The structural isomorphism (theorem 3.2) confirms that the
two approaches describe the same object. The zUSF provides the biological
execution engine that Schreiber's purely mathematical framework lacks.

## 9.3  Hoffman's Conscious Agents Model [@hoffman2019]

Hoffman proposes that spacetime is a "user interface" constructed by
conscious agents; it is not fundamental. The zUSF disagrees on one point:
spacetime ($D_{1-4}$) is physically real and causally efficacious. Brain
surgery alters subjective experience because physical processes in spacetime
causally affect the CEMI field. However, the zUSF agrees that the deeper
structure is relational: conscious percepts are poles in the propagator —
relational objects, not substances. The "conscious agents" in Hoffman's
framework correspond to 11D organisms that have crossed the threshold $T_c$.

# Falsifiability and Predictions

## 11.1  Testable predictions

1. **Therapeutic alliance and barrier height.** Equation (18) predicts that
   $W_\text{eff}$ decreases linearly with $|G_{TC}|^2$. Measuring the Working
   Alliance Inventory (WAI) score as a proxy for $|G_{TC}|^2$ and PTSD
   symptom severity as a proxy for $W_\text{eff}$, the model predicts a
   significant negative correlation between WAI and symptom reduction rate,
   even after controlling for treatment modality.

2. **Neurodivergent temperature profiles.** The model predicts that ADHD
   individuals should show elevated resting-state neural temperature
   (higher effective $\beta^{-1}$ in attractor dwell-time distributions)
   relative to ASC individuals in a same-task fMRI paradigm.

3. **Swarm coordination speedup.** The $O(N^2)$ propagator protocol
   should outperform $O(N \cdot K)$ message-passing for $K > N$. This
   is directly testable with autonomous vehicle fleets ($N=100$,
   $K$ measured empirically).

4. **WKB barrier sweep.** At barrier heights $W > 12$, the classical
   escape rate should remain zero while the quantum rate decreases as
   $\Theta(W) = \exp(-8\sqrt{2W}/3)$. This prediction is testable on
   D-Wave hardware by extending the QUANT-EXP-1 protocol to $W \in \{14,16,18\}$.

## 11.2  Falsification conditions

The framework is falsified if any of the following is observed:

- Classical Langevin dynamics escape the barrier in QUANT-EXP-1 at rate $> 0$
  (contradicts `LimbicTunnel.classical_trapped`)
- The FM-HN under zero stress produces different output than the classical
  1982 network (contradicts `correspondence_principle`)
- The propagator coordination protocol fails to reduce to $O(1)$ application
  steps (contradicts `jam_resistant`)
- Two systems with type-mismatched scale parameters successfully couple
  (contradicts the dependent-type architecture of the Zoom Operator)

# Discussion

## 12.1  Scope and Limitations

The zUSF is a structural claim. It asserts that the same equation governs
propagation at all scales; it does not assert that all scales are
phenomenologically equivalent or that cosmological structures are conscious
in the same sense as biological organisms. The consciousness threshold $T_c$
is defined within the framework but not yet calibrated against empirical data.

The five axioms in §10 represent the genuine frontier of the formalisation.
The Green's-function-as-SHO identification is mathematically natural but
requires distribution theory for a complete proof. The cosmological claims
require linearised general relativity in Mathlib.

## 12.2  The Inductive vs. Deductive Derivation

Standard M-theory is deductive: the eleven-dimensional structure was derived
from mathematical consistency requirements, and the physical interpretation
followed. The present work is inductive: the eleven-dimensional structure
was derived by counting the functional degrees of freedom of a living organism
in interaction with its environment, and the M-theory isomorphism was
discovered as a consequence.

This matters epistemologically. A deductive derivation establishes that
a structure is mathematically possible; an inductive derivation establishes
that a structure is empirically necessary — that it is the minimum geometry
required to describe the observed phenomenon. The zUSF claims necessity,
not merely possibility.

## 12.3  Relation to Existing Work

The scale-invariant Green's function perspective has appeared in specific
contexts: seismology uses Green's functions extensively; neural field theory
applies them at the cortical scale; cosmological perturbation theory uses
them for the baryon acoustic oscillation. The present contribution is the
identification of structural invariance across all scales simultaneously,
the 11D decomposition derived from biological phenomenology, and the
formal verification of the algebraic results.

---

# Open Research Problems

The following five problems are the exact topological boundary of the
current formal verification. Everything not on this list is proved.
These are not vague limitations — each has a known mathematical target
and a clear path to closure.

**Problem 1: The Green's Function SHO Identity (distribution theory).**
The axiom `greens_fn_is_SHO` in `UniversalSomaticField.lean` states that
the Green's function $G(x,x')$ satisfies the SHO equation
$(\partial^2_{x'} + k^2) G(x, \cdot) = \delta(\cdot - x)$
in the sense of distributions. The proof requires Schwartz space and
tempered distribution theory. Mathlib has `MeasureTheory` and
`Distribution`-adjacent infrastructure; the specific result
(fundamental solution of $-\nabla^2 + k^2$) is not yet in Mathlib
as a verified theorem. **Path to closure:** contribute the Yukawa/Helmholtz
Green's function to Mathlib, then discharge the axiom.

**Problem 2: The $G_2$ Compactification Derivation.**
The 7 compact dimensions are currently *postulated* to correspond to the
BRECVEMA mechanisms. A complete derivation would proceed from a
neurodynamical Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}[\psi, \partial\psi]$ over an
8D state space, vary it to obtain the Euler–Lagrange equations, and
show that the resulting moduli space has the homotopy type of a
$G_2$-holonomy manifold. This would replace an identification with a
derivation. **Path to closure:** construct the variational problem over
the BRECVEMA space; use Mathlib's `VariationalCalculus` when available.

**Problem 3: The `FieldLayerType` Functor Upgrade.**
The `FieldLayerType` encoding in `MTheoryIsomorphism.lean` uses `String`
placeholders for the physical content of each layer
(`"NavierStokesFlow"`, `"EinsteinGR"`, `"HopfieldHamiltonian"`).
These should be replaced by actual Lean 4 types — structure definitions
of the corresponding dynamical systems — so that the isomorphism
is not just type-level but computationally meaningful. **Path to closure:**
define `NavierStokesField`, `EinsteinMetric`, `HopfieldNet` as Lean
structures; replace the String tags with these types.

**Problem 4: Path-Dependence in Moduli Space.**
The dissonance coordinate in `manifold_coords.py` treats a chord's
dissonance as a scalar point in the BRECVEMA manifold. Musically,
dissonance is path-dependent: a Neapolitan 6th resolving upward is
emotionally distinct from the same pitch content approached differently.
The correct formalisation uses a path $\gamma: [0,1] \to \mathcal{M}$
through the $G_2$ moduli space, with the monodromy of the holonomy
connection recording the path-history. **Path to closure:** extend
`GeographicSomatic.lean` (once written) to use `PathIntegral` machinery;
update `manifold_coords.py` accordingly.

**Problem 5: The Dyadic Coupling Inequality (Float arithmetic).**
`DyadicField.lean` contains one `sorry`: the theorem that dyadic coupling
lowers energy when $J \geq 0$ and both fields have non-negative activation.
The proof is straightforward over $\mathbb{R}$ (the cross-coupling sum
$\sum_{ij} a_i J_{ij} b_j \geq 0$ when $a_i, b_j, J_{ij} \geq 0$),
but Lean 4's `Float` type is axiomatized and not amenable to algebraic
tactics (`linarith`, `nlinarith` do not apply to Float). **Path to closure:**
re-implement the key energy functions over `ℝ` using Mathlib's `Real`
type; the Float implementations can remain as computational code while
the proofs use the Real-valued versions. This is a refactoring task,
not a mathematical problem.

# Conclusion

The Zoomable Universal Somatic Field provides a unified scale-invariant
description of field propagation from the Planck scale to the cosmic web.
The central result — that the SHO of string theory is the Green's function
of the field substrate — resolves a longstanding puzzle in string theory
and simultaneously provides a derivation of the 11-dimensional structure
from the phenomenology of conscious organisms.

The architecture satisfies three independent criteria for a successful
unification theory:

1. **Structural necessity.** The 11-dimensional decomposition is not
   a convenient choice; it is the minimum number of functional degrees
   of freedom required to describe a living system with body, field,
   homeostasis, and mind.

2. **Formal verification.** The core algebraic results are
   machine-checked. The axiom list is explicit and minimal.

3. **Falsifiability.** The framework makes specific quantitative
   predictions (§11.1) that distinguish it from its competitors.

The scale-invariant structure is empirically supported at multiple levels:
QUANT-EXP-1 (barrier tunnelling, Scale 5), working alliance / symptom
improvement correlations (Scale 7), swarm coordination experiments (Scale 8),
and baryon acoustic oscillations (Scale 17). The remaining predictions
(§11.1 items 2–4) are testable with currently available hardware.

The equation is simple. The implications are large.

$$\boxed{(\nabla^2 + k^2)\, G(x, x') = \delta(x - x')}$$
